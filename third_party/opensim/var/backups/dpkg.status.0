Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 'Adduser' will choose UID and GID values that conform to Debian policy,
 create a home directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and
 automate setting initial values for the user's password, real name
 and so on.
 .
 'Deluser' can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .
 'Adduser' and 'Deluser' are intended to be used by the local
 administrator in lieu of the tools from the 'useradd' suite, and
 they provide support for easy use from Debian package maintainer
 scripts, functioning as kind of a policy layer to make those scripts
 easier and more stable to write and maintain.

Description: Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts
 AGL (Adobe Glyph List) maps glyph names to Unicode values for the
 purpose of deriving content. AGLFN (Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts) is a
 subset of AGL that excludes the glyph names associated with the PUA
 (Private Use Area), and is meant to specify preferred glyph names for
 new fonts. Also included is the ITC Zapf Dingbats Glyph List, which is
 similar to AGL in that it maps glyph names to Unicode values for the
 purpose of deriving content, but only for the glyphs in the ITC Zapf
 Dingbats font.
 .
 Be sure to visit the AGL Specification and Developer Documentation pages
 for detailed information about naming glyphs, interpreting glyph names,
 and developing OpenType fonts.

Description: ALSA driver configuration files
 This package contains various configuration files for
 the ALSA drivers.
 .
 For ALSA to work on a system with a given sound card,
 there must be an ALSA driver for that card in the kernel.
 Linux 2.6 as shipped in linux-image packages contains
 ALSA drivers for all supported sound cards in the form
 of loadable modules. A custom alsa-modules package can
 be built from the sources in the alsa-source package
 using the m-a utility (included in the module-assistant
 package). Please read the README.Debian file for more
 information about loading and building modules.

Description: cron-like program that doesn't go by time
 Anacron (like "anac(h)ronistic") is a periodic command scheduler.  It
 executes commands at intervals specified in days.  Unlike cron, it
 does not assume that the system is running continuously.  It can
 therefore be used to control the execution of daily, weekly, and
 monthly jobs (or anything with a period of n days), on systems that
 don't run 24 hours a day.  When installed and configured properly,
 Anacron will make sure that the commands are run at the specified
 intervals as closely as machine uptime permits.
 .
 This package is pre-configured to execute the daily jobs of the
 Debian system.  You should install this program if your system isn't
 powered on 24 hours a day to make sure the maintenance jobs of other
 Debian packages are executed each day.

Description: Automated Password Generator - Standalone version
 APG (Automated Password Generator) is the tool set for random
 password generation. It generates some random words of required type
 and prints them to standard output. This binary package contains only
 the standalone version of apg.
 Advantages:
  * Built-in ANSI X9.17 RNG (Random Number Generator)(CAST/SHA1)
  * Built-in password quality checking system (now it has support for Bloom
    filter for faster access)
  * Two Password Generation Algorithms:
     1. Pronounceable Password Generation Algorithm (according to NIST
        FIPS 181)
     2. Random Character Password Generation Algorithm with 35
        configurable modes of operation
  * Configurable password length parameters
  * Configurable amount of generated passwords
  * Ability to initialize RNG with user string
  * Support for /dev/random
  * Ability to crypt() generated passwords and print them as additional output.
  * Special parameters to use APG in script
  * Ability to log password generation requests for network version
  * Ability to control APG service access using tcpd
  * Ability to use password generation service from any type of box (Mac,
    WinXX, etc.) that connected to network
  * Ability to enforce remote users to use only allowed type of password
    generation
 The client/server version of apg has been deliberately omitted.
 .
 Please note that there are security flaws in pronounceable
 password generation schemes (see Ganesan / Davis "A New Attack on
 Random Pronounceable Password Generators", in "Proceedings of the 17th
 National Computer Security Conference (NCSC), Oct. 11-14, 1994
 (Volume 1)", http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/history/nissc/
 1994-17th-NCSC-proceedings-vol-1.pdf, pages 203-216)
 .
 Also note that the FIPS 181 standard from 1993 has been withdrawn by NIST in
 2015 with no superseding publication. This means that the document is
 considered by its publicher as obsolete and not been updated to reference
 current or revised voluntary industry standards, federal specifications, or
 federal data standards.
 .
 apg has not seen upstream attention since 2003, upstream is not
 answering e-mail, and the upstream web page does not look like it is
 in good working order. The Debian maintainer plans to discontinue apg
 maintenance as soon as an actually maintained software with a
 compariable feature set becomes available.

 Apport intercepts program crashes, collects debugging information about the
 crash and the operating system environment, and sends it to bug trackers in a
 standardized form. It also offers the user to report a bug about a package,
 with again collecting as much information about it as possible.
 .
 This package extends Apport by some "symptom" scripts, so that bug reporters
 do not have to guess the correct package, but report problems based on
 symptoms that they have (like "sound problem"), through an interactive process.

Description: Software component metadata management
 AppStream is a metadata specification which permits software components to
 provide information about themselves to automated systems and end-users
 before the software is actually installed.
 The AppStream project provides facilities to easily access and transform
 this metadata, as well as a few additional services to allow building
 feature-rich software centers and similar applications.
 .
 This package provides tools to generate, maintain and query the AppStream
 data pool of installed and available software, and enables integration
 with the APT package manager.
 .
 The 'appstreamcli' tool can be used for accessing the software component
 pool as well as for working with AppStream metadata directly, including
 validating it for compliance with the specification.

Description: container platform focused on supporting "Mobility of Compute" formerly known as Singularity
 Mobility of Compute encapsulates the development to compute model
 where developers can work in an environment of their choosing and
 creation and when the developer needs additional compute resources,
 this environment can easily be copied and executed on other platforms.
 Additionally as the primary use case for Apptainer is targeted
 towards computational portability, many of the barriers to entry of
 other container solutions do not apply to Apptainer making it an
 ideal solution for users (both computational and non-computational)
 and HPC centers.

Description: detect architectures supported by your machine/kernel
 This package lets you enumerate architectures that your kernel can run.
 The check is for the ability to run machine code and supporting appropriate
 syscall ABI -- you may need to install userland libraries in a chroot,
 container or via multiarch to actually execute non-static binaries of such
 architectures.
 .
 Also provided is "elf-arch", a tool to determine the architecture of an ELF
 binary (program or library).
 .
 Architectures detected by this version of arch-test are:
  * amd64, i386, x32
  * mips, mipsel, mips64, mips64el

Description: GNU Aspell spell-checker
 GNU Aspell is a spell-checker which can be used either as a standalone
 application or embedded in other programs.  Its main feature is that it
 does a much better job of suggesting possible spellings than just about
 any other spell-checker available for the English language, including
 Ispell and Microsoft Word.  It also has many other technical
 enhancements over Ispell such as using shared memory for dictionaries
 and intelligently handling personal dictionaries when more than one
 Aspell process is open at once.
 .
 Aspell is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Ispell.

Description: Tool for generating GNU Standards-compliant Makefiles
 Automake is a tool for automatically generating `Makefile.in's from

 .
 The goal of Automake is to remove the burden of Makefile maintenance
 from the back of the individual GNU maintainer (and put it on the back
 of the Automake maintainer).
 .
 The `Makefile.am' is basically a series of `make' macro definitions
 (with rules being thrown in occasionally).  The generated
 `Makefile.in's are compliant with the GNU Makefile standards.
 .
 Automake 1.16 fails to work in a number of situations that Automake
 1.11, and 1.15 did, so some previous versions are available as separate
 packages.

 local database) and forget them again (remove previously enrolled
 devices). It also emits signals if new devices are connected (or
 removed). During enrollment devices can be set to be automatically
 authorized as soon as they are connected.  A command line tool, called
 boltctl, can be used to control the daemon and perform all the above
 mentioned tasks.

 Packet Filter (eBPF) available in recent Linux kernels (4.x). BPFtrace
 uses LLVM as a backend to compile scripts to BPF-bytecode and makes
 use of BCC for interacting with the Linux BPF system, as well as
 existing Linux tracing capabilities: kernel dynamic tracing (kprobes),
 user-level dynamic tracing (uprobes), and tracepoints. The BPFtrace
 language is inspired by awk and C, and predecessor tracers such as
 DTrace and SystemTap.

Description: simple mail user agent
 bsd-mailx is the traditional simple command-line-mode mail user agent.
 Even if you don't use it, it may be required by other programs.
 .
 The /usr/bin/mail command provided by this package is a very simple one,
 and does not include many features that can be found in more advanced
 mail user agents.
 .
 For example bsd-mailx DOES NOT support:
  - MIME           (i.e. no attachments, no UTF-8 or other charsets support);
  - SMTP protocol  (/usr/sbin/sendmail interface only is used);
  - POP3/IMAP      (bsd-mailx reads local mailboxes only);
  - maildir format (traditional mbox only format is supported).
 .
 If the above features are needed, please consider installing another package
 providing similar /usr/bin/mail interface:
  - s-nail package,
  - or mailutils package.

Description: utility for unprivileged chroot and namespace manipulation
 bubblewrap uses Linux namespaces to launch unprivileged containers.
 These containers can be used to sandbox semi-trusted applications such
 as Flatpak apps, image/video thumbnailers and web browser components,
 or to run programs in a different library stack such as a Flatpak runtime
 or a different Debian release.
 .
 By default, this package relies on a kernel with user namespaces enabled.
 Official Debian and Ubuntu kernels are suitable.
 .
 On kernels without user namespaces, system administrators can make the
 bwrap executable setuid root, allowing it to create unprivileged
 containers even though ordinary user processes cannot.

Description: Informational list of build-essential packages
 If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this
 package.  Starting with dpkg (>= 1.14.18) this package is required
 for building Debian packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

Description: Standalone shell setup for initramfs
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.

 only the basic utilities needed for the initramfs.

 .
 busybox-static provides you with a statically linked simple stand alone shell
 that provides all the utilities available in BusyBox. This package is
 intended to be used as a rescue shell, in the event that you screw up your
 system. Invoke "busybox sh" and you have a standalone shell ready to save
 your system from certain destruction. Invoke "busybox", and it will list the
 available builtin commands.

Description: console font and keymap setup program
 This package provides the console with the same keyboard
 configuration scheme as the X Window System. As a result, there is no
 need to duplicate or change the keyboard files just to make simple
 customizations such as the use of dead keys, the key functioning as
 AltGr or Compose key, the key(s) to switch between Latin and
 non-Latin mode, etc.
 .
 The package also installs console fonts supporting many of the
 world's languages.  It provides an unified set of font faces - the
 classic VGA, the simplistic Fixed, and the cleaned Terminus,
 TerminusBold and TerminusBoldVGA.

Description: disk encryption support - startup scripts
 Cryptsetup provides an interface for configuring encryption on block
 devices (such as /home or swap partitions), using the Linux kernel
 device mapper target dm-crypt. It features integrated Linux Unified Key
 Setup (LUKS) support.
 .
 Cryptsetup is backwards compatible with the on-disk format of cryptoloop,
 but also supports more secure formats. This package includes support for
 automatically configuring encrypted devices at boot time via the config
 file /etc/crypttab. Additional features are cryptoroot support through
 initramfs-tools and several supported ways to read a passphrase or key.
 .
 This package provides the cryptdisks_start and _stop wrappers, as well as
 luksformat.

Description: OpenPrinting cups-browsed
 This package provides cups-browsed, a daemon which browses the Bonjour
 broadcasts of shared remote CUPS printers and makes the printers
 available locally, replacing the CUPS broadcasting/browsing which was
 dropped in CUPS 1.6.x. This way the old behavior of having the remote
 printers available automatically is now re-implemented with Bonjour.
 .
 cups-browsed is also useful with a CUPS >= 1.6 client to allow the
 latter to browse the printer list of CUPS < 1.6 servers (by using the
 old 'cups' protocol in BrowseRemoteProtocols).
 .
 cups-browsed is also useful with a CUPS >= 1.6 server to allow CUPS <

Description: Concurrent Versions System
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep access
 to old versions  of files (usually source code), keep a log of
 who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS.
 It handles multiple developers, multiple directories, triggers to
 enable/log/control various operations, and can work over a wide
 area network. The texinfo manual provides further information on
 more tasks that it can perform.
 .
 There are some tasks that are not covered by CVS. They can be done in
 conjunction with CVS but will tend to require some script-writing and
 software other than CVS. These tasks are bug-tracking, build management
 (that is, make and make-like tools), and automated testing. However,
 CVS makes these tasks easier.
 .
 This package contains a CVS binary which can act as both client and
 server, although there is no CVS dæmon; to access remote repositories,
 please use :extssh: not :pserver: any more.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (system message bus)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package provides a fully-functional D-Bus system bus with activation
 support, used for communication between system services, and depends on
 most of the other components of the reference implementation of D-Bus.
 .
 To provide a complete D-Bus session bus, install one of the packages
 that implement the dbus-session-bus virtual package, such as
 dbus-user-session. The recommended implementation is indicated by
 the default-dbus-session-bus virtual package.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .
 See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general.

  - debc: List contents of current package.  Do this after a successful
    "debuild" to see if the package looks all right.
  - debchange (abbreviation dch): Modifies debian/changelog and manages version
    numbers for you.  It will either increment the version number or add an
    entry for the current version, depending upon the options given to it.
    [libdistro-info-perl, libsoap-lite-perl]*
  - debcheckout: checkout the development repository of a Debian package. *
  - debclean: Clean a Debian source tree.  Debclean will clean all Debian
    source trees below the current directory, and if requested, also remove
    all files that were generated from these source trees (that is .deb, .dsc
    and .changes files).  It will keep the .diffs and original files, though,
    so that the binaries and other files can be rebuilt if necessary. *
  - debcommit: Commits changes to cvs, darcs, svn, svk, tla, bzr, git, or hg,
    using new entries in debian/changelog as the commit message. Also supports
    tagging Debian package releases. [cvs | darcs | subversion | svk | tla |
    bzr | git-core | mercurial, libtimedate-perl]
  - debdiff: A program which examines two .deb files or two .changes files and
    reports on any difference found in their file lists.  Useful for ensuring
    that no files were inadvertently lost between versions.  Can also examine
    two .dsc files and report on the changes between source versions.
    For a deeper comparison one can use the diffoscope package.
    [wdiff, patchutils]*
  - debdiff-apply: Apply unified diffs of two Debian source packages, such as
    those generated by debdiff, to a target Debian source package. Any changes
    to debian/changelog are dealt with specially, to avoid the conflicts that
    changelog diffs typically produce when applied naively. May be used to check
    that old patches still apply to newer versions of those packages.
    [python3-debian, python3-unidiff, quilt]

    The ability to install the package with a very short command is very
    useful when troubleshooting packages.
  - debootsnap: Combines debootstrap and snapshot.debian.org to create a chroot
    containing exactly the requested selection of packages. This can be used
    to re-create a chroot from the past, for example to reproduce a bug. The

    build a given source directory twice, with a set of variation between the
    first and second build, and compare the binary packages produced. If
    diffoscope is installed, it is used to compare non-matching binaries. If
    disorderfs is installed, it is used during the build to inject
    non-determinism in filesystem listing operations.

Description: debhelper add-on to call autoreconf and clean up after the build
 dh-autoreconf provides a debhelper sequence addon named 'autoreconf' and two
 commands, dh_autoreconf and dh_autoreconf_clean.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf command creates a list of the files and their checksums,
 calls autoreconf and then creates a second list for the new files.
 .
 The dh_autoreconf_clean command compares these two lists and removes all
 files which have been added or changed (files may be excluded if needed).
 .
 For CDBS users, a rule is provided to call the dh-autoreconf programs at
 the right time.

Description: file non-deterministic information stripper — Debhelper add-on
 StripNondeterminism is a library for stripping non-deterministic information
 such as timestamps and filesystem ordering from various file and archive
 formats.
 .
 This can be used as a post-processing step to improve the reproducibility of a
 build product, when the build process itself cannot be made deterministic.
 .
 It is used as part of the Reproducible Builds project, although it should be
 considered a temporary workaround which should not be needed in the long
 term; upstream software should be reproducible even without using such a tool.
 .
 This package installs the ‘dh_strip_nondeterminism’ Debhelper command that
 strips nondeterminism as part of a Debian package build process.

 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.

 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI,
 ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
 USB).
 .
 Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted.
 Dmidecode does not scan the hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to.

Description: standard XML documentation system for software and systems
 DocBook is an XML document type definition (DTD).  That is, it
 contains the "DocBook" document structure.  This is used by authors
 or editors writing documents in the DocBook XML format.  DocBook was
 designed for books, articles, or reference documentation about
 technical matters or software.  It has emerged as an open, standard
 DTD in the software industry, and is the documentation system of
 choice for many free software projects.
 .
 This package contains the XML DTD for DocBook, which describes the
 formal structure for documents following this format.  If you wish to
 author DocBook documents using SGML rather than XML, use the
 'docbook' package.  You will need other packages in order to edit
 (psgml), validate (opensp, libxml2-utils) or format (docbook-xsl,
 docbook-dsssl) DocBook documents.
 .
 This package ships with the latest DocBook 4.5 XML DTD, as well as a
 selected set of legacy DTDs for use with older documents, including
 4.0, 4.1.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.

Description: Library and utilities designed to disable fsync and friends
 This package contains a small LD_PRELOAD library (libeatmydata) and a couple
 of helper utilities designed to transparently disable fsync and friends (like
 open(O_SYNC)). This has two side-effects: making software that writes data
 safely to disk a lot quicker and making this software no longer crash safe.
 .
 You will find eatmydata useful if particular software calls fsync(), sync()
 etc. frequently but the data it stores is not that valuable to you and you may
 afford losing it in case of system crash. Data-to-disk synchronization calls
 are typically very slow on modern file systems and their extensive usage might
 slow down software significantly. It does not make sense to accept such a hit
 in performance if data being manipulated is not very important.
 .
 On the other hand, do not use eatmydata when you care about what software
 stores or it manipulates important components of your system. The library is
 called libEAT-MY-DATA for a reason.

Description: Multi-lingual software speech synthesizer
 eSpeak is a software speech synthesizer for English, and some other
 languages.
 .
 eSpeak produces good quality English speech. It uses a different synthesis
 method from other open source text to speech (TTS) engines, and sounds quite
 different. It's perhaps not as natural or "smooth", but some find the
 articulation clearer and easier to listen to for long periods.
 .
 It can run as a command line program to speak text from a file or from stdin.
 .
   * Includes different Voices, whose characteristics can be altered.
   * Can produce speech output as a WAV file.
   * Can translate text to phoneme codes, so it could be adapted as a front end
     for another speech synthesis engine.
   * Potential for other languages. More than 40 languages are included.
   * Compact size. The program and its data total about 350 kbytes.
   * Written in C++.

 .
 Features:
 .
  * Convenient syntax: ‘fd PATTERN’ instead of ‘find -iname '*PATTERN*'’.
  * Colorized terminal output (similar to ls).
  * It's fast, often faster than find.
  * Smart case.
  * Ignores hidden directories and files, by default.
  * Ignores patterns from your .gitignore, by default.
  * Regular expressions.
  * Unicode-awareness.
  * Parallel command execution with a syntax similar to GNU Parallel.
 .
  Please note: the executable and the associated manpage were renamed
  from ‘fd’ to ‘fdfind’ because of a file name clash.

 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma

Description: ancient Greek font revival
 John Baskerville (1706-1775) got involved in typography late in his
 career but his contribution was significant. He was a successful
 entrepreneur and possessed an inquiring mind which he applied to
 produce many aesthetic and technical innovations in printing. He
 invented a new ink formula, a new type of smooth paper and made
 various improvements in the printing press. He was also involved in
 type design which resulted in a latin typeface which was used for the
 edition of Virgil, in 1757.  The quality of the type was admired
 throughout of Europe and America and was revived with great success
 in the early 20th century. Baskerville was also involved in the
 design of a Greek typeface which he used in an edition of the New
 Testament for Oxford University, in 1763. He adopted the practice of
 avoiding the excessive number of ligatures which Alexander Wilson had
 started a few years earlier but his Greek types were rather narrow in
 proportion and did not win the sympathy of the philologists and other
 scholars of his time. They did influence, however, the Greek types of
 Giambattista Bodoni. and through him Didot's Greek in Paris.  The
 typeface has been digitally revived as GFS Baskerville Classic by
 Sophia Kalaitzidou and George D. Matthiopoulos and is now available
 as part of GFS' type library.

 Neohellenic is a Greek font family characterized by round, even pen

 .
 Former Greek types had harked back to classical models. In 1927,
 Victor Scholderer chose instead to revive one which had first
 appeared in a 1492 printing of Macrobius attributed to Joannes
 Rubeus. In 1993-4 the typeface was digitized by the Greek Font
 Society, with the addition of a new set of epigraphic symbols.

Description: ancient Greek oblique font revival (companion to GFS Didot)
 In Greece the terms italic and oblique have the same meaning since
 they are borrowed from the latin typographic practice without any
 real historical equivalent in Greek history. Until the end of the
 19th century Greek typefaces were cut and cast independently, not as
 members of a typefamily. The mechanisation of typecutting allowed the
 transformation of upright Greek typefaces to oblique designs.
 Nonetheless, the typesetting practice of a cursive Greek font to
 complement an upright one did not survive the 19th century. The
 experimental font GFS Olga (1995) attempts to revive this lost
 tradition. The typeface was designed and digitised by George
 Matthiopoulos, based on the historical Porson Greek type (1803) with
 the intention to be the companion of the upright GFS Didot font
 whenever there is a need for an italic alternative.

Description: Greek font (Porson revival)
 In England, during the 1790's, Cambridge University Press decided to procure a
 new set of Greek types. The university’s great scholar of Classics, Richard
 Porson was asked to produce a typeface based on his handsome handwriting and
 Richard Austin was commissioned to cut the types. The type was completed in
 1808, after the untimely death of Porson the previous year. Its success was
 immediate and since then the classical editions in Great Britain and the
 U.S.A.  use it, almost invariably. In 1913, Monotype released the typeface
 with some corrections, notably replacing the upright capitals suggested by
 Porson with inclined ones. In Greece the typeface was used under the name
 Pelasgika type. GFS Porson is based on the Monotype version, though using
 upright capitals, as in the original.

Description: ancient Greek oblique font
 From the middle of the 19th century an italic font with many
 calligraphic overtones was introduced into Greek printing. Its source
 is unknown, but it almost certainly was the product of a German or
 Italian foundry. In the first type specimen printed in Greece by the
 typecutter K. Miliadis (1850), the font was listed anonymously along
 others of 11pts and in the Gr. Doumas' undated specimen appeared as
 «11pt Greek inclined». For most of the second half of the century the
 type was used extensively as an italic for emphasis in words,
 sentences or excerpts. In 1889, the folio size Type Specimen of
 Anestis Konstantinidis' publishing, printing and type founding
 establishment also included the type as «Greek inclined [9 & 12 pt]».
 .
 Nevertheless, the excessively calligraphic style of the characters,
 combined with the steep and uncomfortable obliqueness of the
 capitals, was out of favour in the 20th century and the type did not
 survive the conformity of the mechanical type cutting and casting.
 The font has been digitally revived, as part of our typographic
 tradition, by George D.  Matthiopoulos and is part of GFS' type
 library under the name GFS Solomos, in commemoration of the great
 Greek poet of the 19th century, Dionisios Solomos.

Description: Typeface designed for source code
 No frills. No gimmicks. Hack is hand groomed and optically balanced to be a
 workhorse face for code.
 .
 It has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and expands upon
 the contributions of the Bitstream Vera & DejaVu projects. The face has been
 re-designed with a larger glyph set, modifications of the original glyph shapes
 (including distinct point styles and semi-bold punctuation weight in the
 regular set to make analphabetic characters less transparent), and meticulous
 attention to metrics (including numerous spacing adjustments to improve the
 rhythm of the face and the legibility of code at small text sizes). The large
 x-height + wide aperture + low contrast design combined with PostScript
 hinting/hint replacement programs and a TrueType instruction set make it highly
 legible at commonly used source code text sizes with a sweet spot that runs in
 the 8px - 12px range on modern desktop and laptop monitors.
 .
 This package contains the TrueType fonts and the Webfont (WOFF/WOFF2) versions.

 version ("Linux Libertine") and a Sans Serif ("Linux Biolinum") designed
 to be used together as an alternative for Times/Times New Roman (and, in
 part, Helvetica/Arial).
 .
 The Serif typeface comes in two shapes and two weights (that is, the
 usual Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic), and an Small Capitals
 version of the regular typeface. Linux Biolinum, the Sans Serif
 typeface, is available in both Regular and Bold weights.
 .
 This package contains OpenType versions (i.e., with cubic Bézier splines)
 of the fonts, with large support of OpenType features.

Description: OpenType fonts based on Computer Modern
 The Latin Modern fonts, also known as "lm fonts", are a set of
 scalable fonts in PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. They are
 based on the PostScript Type 1 version of the Computer Modern fonts
 and contain many additional characters (mostly accented ones).
 .
 This package provides the OpenType variant of these fonts. For support
 for TeX and Type 1 (PostScript) fonts, see the lmodern package.
 .
 The Latin Modern fonts were generated using MetaType1, a program
 based on MetaPost for generating PostScript Type 1 fonts
 (ftp://bop.eps.gda.pl/pub/metatype1/). Their size is reasonable and
 they are usually considered to be of good quality (compared to
 cm-super, for instance; however, cm-super contains font families
 that have no equivalent in this package; additionally, there are
 character sets that are supported by cm-super and not by the Latin
 Modern fonts).

Description: bold condensed script with many ligatures and alternates
 The beauty of real hand-drawn lettering is that the lettering artists subtly
 modify the shape of letters so they connect with the next ones. These linked
 letters-pairs are called "ligatures". Thus, in order to provide a smooth
 hand-written look, the Lobster font provides a large number of ligatures,
 as well as terminal forms (i.e. glyphs that are used for word endings).

Description: Font family designed for literacy use
 Andika ("Write!" in Swahili) is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font
 designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of
 beginning readers. The focus is on clear, easy-to-perceive letterforms that
 will not be easily confused with one another.
 .
 A sans serif font is preferred by some literacy personnel for teaching
 people to read. Its forms are simpler and less cluttered than some serif
 fonts can be. For years, literacy workers have had to make do with fonts
 that were available but not really suitable for beginning readers and
 writers. In some cases, literacy specialists have had to tediously cobble
 together letters from a variety of fonts in order to get the all of
 characters they need for their particular language project, resulting in
 confusing and unattractive publications. Andika addresses those issues.
 .
 Four fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
  * Andika Regular
  * Andika Bold
  * Andika Italic
  * Andika Bold Italic
 .
 Webfont versions and HTML/CSS examples are also available.
 .
 The full font sources are publicly available at
 https://github.com/silnrsi/font-andika
 An open workflow is used for building, testing and releasing.

Description: Font family for wide range of languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts
 Charis is similar to Bitstream Charter, one of the first fonts designed
 specifically for laser printers. It is highly readable and holds up well in
 less-than-ideal reproduction environments. It also has a full set of styles
 - regular, italic, bold, bold italic - and so is more useful in general
 publishing than Doulos SIL. Charis is a serif proportionally spaced font
 optimized for readability in long printed documents.
 .
 The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font family
 that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
 Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
 orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and
 symbols useful to linguists. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
 technologies to support complex typographic issues, such as the need to
 position arbitrary combinations of base glyphs and diacritics optimally.
 .
 Four fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
     * Charis SIL Regular
     * Charis SIL Bold
     * Charis SIL Italic

Description: extended Unicode Latin font ("a typeface for the nations")
 Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
 designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use
 the Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design
 is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually
 attractive. Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design"
 in two major international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001)
 and TDC2003 (2003).
 .
 Gentium provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Greek characters. The
 additional 'extended' Latin letters are designed to naturally harmonize with
 the traditional 26 ones. Diacritics are treated with careful thought and
 attention to their use. Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek,
 including a number of alternate forms. It currently supports the following
 ranges of Unicode 3.0 (completely unless noted):
 .
  Range          Description
 .
  U+0020-U+007F  Basic Latin
  U+00A0-U+00FF  Latin-1 Supplement
  U+0100-U+017F  Latin Extended-A
  U+0180-U+021F  Latin Extended-B
  U+0222-U+0233  Latin Extended-B (continued)
  U+0250-U+02AD  IPA Extensions
  U+02B0-U+02FF  Spacing Modifier Letters
  U+0300-U+036F  Combining Diacritical Marks
  U+0370-U+03D5  Greek (not including archaic or Coptic)
  U+1E00-U+1EFF  Latin Extended Additional
  U+1F00-U+1FFF  Greek Extended
  U+2000-U+203A  General Punctuation (partial)
  U+2070-U+209F  Superscripts and Subscripts
  U+20A0-U+20CF  Currency Symbols (partial)
  U+2100-U+214F  Letterlike Symbols (only a couple)
 .
 Gentium Regular also includes some Cyrillic glyphs, but they are only early
 drafts. A future version will include a completely revised set, including
 italic, and will expand the support for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic to Unicode
 4.1.
 .
 GentiumAlt is an alternate font with flatter diacritics, specifically
 designed for languages using multiple accents.
 .
 The extended sources (Fontlab .vfb) for this font family are available
 in the source package and on the project website.

Description: smart Unicode font families (Basic and Book Basic) based on Gentium
 Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic are font families based on the original
 Gentium design, but with additional weights. The "Book" family is slightly
 heavier. Both families come with a complete regular, bold, italic and bold
 italic set of fonts.
 .
 The supported character set, however, is much smaller than for the main
 Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts support only the Basic Latin and Latin-1
 Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended
 Latin characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and
 punctuation. A much more complete character set will be supported in a future
 version of the complete Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts are intended as a
 way to provide additional weights for basic font users without waiting until
 the complete Gentium character set is finished.
 .
 There are, however, some wonderful new features that are still missing from
 the main Gentium family:
  * Bold
  * Bold Italic
  * The slightly-heavier Book family
  * OpenType and Graphite smart code for diacritic placement
  * A few useful OpenType and Graphite features
  * Support for a few more recent additions to Unicode
  * Character assignments updated to Unicode 5.1

Description: extended smart font family for Latin, Greek and Cyrillic
 Gentium ("belonging to the nations" in Latin) is a Unicode typeface family
 designed to enable the many diverse ethnic groups around the world who use the
 Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications. The design is
 intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and visually attractive.
 Gentium has won a "Certificate of Excellence in Typeface Design" in two major
 international typeface design competitions: bukva:raz! (2001) and TDC2003
 (2003). The goal is to provide a single Unicode-based font family that
 contains a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any Roman- or
 Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or orthographic
 needs, and provide a matching Greek face. In addition, there is provision for
 other characters and symbols useful to linguists. This font makes use of
 state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic issues, such
 as the need to position arbitrary combinations of base glyphs and diacritics
 optimally.
 .
 Gentium Plus is based on the original Gentium design. However, it now
 has the full OpenType and Graphite support that Doulos SIL and Charis
 SIL contain — including full IPA support.
 .
 Gentium Plus Compact is a dedicated derivative with line spacing metrics
 modified to "Tight" via TypeTuner. More font sources (including web
 fonts and corresponding examples) are available in the main Gentium Plus
 release.
 .
 Work is ongoing to provide bold and bold-italic weights, as well as a
 complete book-weight family.
 .
 Webfont versions and HTML/CSS examples are also available.

Description: OpenType fonts based on URW Fonts
 The TeX Gyre project, following the Latin Modern project, aims at providing
 a rich collection of diacritical characters in the attempt to cover as many
 Latin-based scripts as possible.
 .
 This package provides the OpenType variant of these fonts. For support
 for TeX and Type 1 (PostScript) fonts, see the tex-gyre package.
 .
 The TeX-GYRE bundle consists of seven font families:
 .
 The TeX Gyre Adventor family of fonts is based on the URW Gothic L
 family (designed by Herb Lubalin and Tom Carnase).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Bonum family of fonts is based on the URW Bookman L family
 (designed by Alexander Phemister).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Chorus font is based on URW Chancery L Medium Italic
 (designed by Hermann Zapf (ITC Zapf Chancery(R), 1979)).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Cursor family is based on the URW Nimbus Mono L family
 (designed by Howard G. (Bud) Kettler in 1955 for the IBM corporation).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Heros family of fonts is based on the URW Nimbus Sans L
 (prepared by Max Miedinger, with Eduard Hoffmann).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Pagella family of fonts is based on the URW Palladio L
 family (designed by Hermann Zapf).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Schola family of fonts is based on the URW Century
 Schoolbook L family (designed by Morris Fuller Benton).
 .
 The TeX Gyre Termes is based on the URW Nimbus Roman No9 L family
 (designed by Stanley Morison together with Starling Burgess and
 Victor Lardent).
 .
 The constituent 4 standard faces of each family have been greatly
 extended, and contain nearly 1200 glyphs each.  Each family is
 available in Adobe Type 1 and Open Type formats, and LaTeX support
 (for use with a variety of encodings) is provided.  Vietnamese
 characters were added by Han The Thanh.

Description: OpenPrinting printer support - Compressed PPDs derived from the database
 Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up
 common printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems).
 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and
 your actual printer, by telling your computer how to process files
 sent to the printer.
 .
 This package contains all PPD files which can be generated from the Foomatic
 database as one small compressed archive. This reduces the disk space
 consumption compared to the Foomatic XML database vastly and in addition
 makes listing of all available PPDs and extracting the needed PPD much faster
 than using the Foomatic XML database.

  - Customisable — change the color palette, font families, logo and more!
  - Easy to navigate — with carefully-designed sidebar navigation and
    inter-page links.
  - Good looking content — through clear typography and well-stylised elements.
  - Good looking search — helps readers find what they want quickly.
  - Biased for smaller docsets — intended for smaller documentation sets,
    where presenting the entire hierarchy in the sidebar is not overwhelming.

Description: Optimise Linux system performance on demand
 GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set
 of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS.
 .
 The design has a clear-cut abstraction between the host daemon and library
 (gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client loaders (libgamemodeauto and
 gamemode_client.h) that allows for safe use without worrying about whether
 the daemon is installed or running. This design also means that while the
 host library currently relies on systemd for exchanging messages with the
 daemon, it's entirely possible to implement other internals that still work
 with the same clients.
 .
 GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with
 the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is intended to
 be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are a wealth of
 automation tasks one might want to apply.
 .
 This package is a metapackage including everything that is necessary to run
 gamemode-enabled games or to enable it by hand for applications. It includes
 a program called '/usr/games/gamemoderun', which can invoke gamemode into any
 application. It also includes '/usr/games/gamemode-simulate-game', which
 invokes gamemode, sleeps for 10 seconds and then exits. This allows you to
 test whether gamemode is working properly on your system, it will return
 gamemode's error message if something went wrong, otherwise it will exit with
 a 0 status.

Description: GNOME Display Manager
 GDM provides the equivalent of a "login:" prompt for X displays: it
 asks for a login and starts graphical sessions.
 .
 It supports multiple seats and switching between multiple users.
 .
 The greeter is based on the GNOME libraries and applications, and its
 look and design are the same as those of a GNOME session.

Description: Screensaver and screen lock formerly used in GNOME
 gnome-screensaver is a simple screen saver and screen lock, used in older
 versions of the GNOME desktop environment.
 .
 It is designed to support, among other things:
 .
  * the ability to lock down configuration settings
  * translation into other languages
  * user switching
 .
 This package is not necessary in the GNOME desktop environment, because
 GNOME Shell contains its own screen lock implementation. It can be
 used with alternative desktop environments.

Description: extension which adds a Windows-like snap assist to GNOME Shell
 An extension which adds a Windows-like snap assist to GNOME Shell.
 .
 It also expands GNOME's 2 column tiling design and adds more features, like:
  * Tiling Popup: This is the popup, which shows up when a window is tiled and
    there is an (unambiguous) free screen rectangle. It lists all open windows
    on the current workspace. Activating one of the popup's icons will tile the
    window to fill the remaining screen space.
  * Tile Groups: Tiled windows are considered in a group, if they don't overlap
    each other and aren't interrupted by non-tiled windows. If one of the
    windows is focused, the rest of the group will be raised to the foreground
    as well. A Tile Group also resizes together.
  * Layouts: A layout is a list of arbitrary rectangles. When activating one
    with its keybinding the Tiling Popup asks you which of the open windows you
    want at which spot of your layout. The layout selector is a popup, which
    will lists all defined layouts by name. This way you don't have to remember
    the layouts' keybindings.
  * Pie Menu: Super + RMB on a window will open a simple pie menu.

 Software lets you install and update applications and system extensions.
 .
 Software uses a plugin architecture to separate the frontend from the
 technologies that are used underneath. Currently, a PackageKit plugin provides
 data from a number of traditional packaging systems, such as rpm or apt. An
 appdata plugin provides additional metadata from locally installed data in the
 appdata format.
 .
 This package contains the Snap plugin.

Description: Cross-platform configuration utilities
 These System Tools (known as GNOME System Tools) are a set of tools aimed to
 make easy the job that means the computer administration on an UNIX or Linux
 system. They're thought to help from the new Linux or UNIX user to the system
 administrators.
 .
 Its main advantages are:
  * An user-friendly interface to carry out the main administration tasks.
  * The use of a common user interface in every system.
  * A common structure that makes easy the development of new system tools.
 Nowadays there are tools for managing:
  - Users and groups
  - Date and time
  - Shares (NFS and Samba)

Description: rich set of graph drawing tools
 Graph drawing addresses the problem of visualizing structural information
 by constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and networks.
 Automatic generation of graph drawings has important applications in key
 technologies such as database design, software engineering, VLSI and
 network design and visual interfaces in other domains. Situations where
 these tools might be particularly useful include:
 .
   * you would like to restructure a program and first need to understand
     the relationships between its types, procedures, and source files
   * you need to find the bottlenecks in an Internet backbone - not only
     individual links, but their relationships
   * you're debugging a protocol or microarchitecture represented as a
     finite state machine and need to figure out how a certain
     error state arises
   * you would like to browse a database schema, knowledge base, or
     distributed program represented graphically
   * you would like to see an overview of a collection of linked documents
   * you would like to discover patterns and communities of interest in a
     database of telephone calls or e-mail messages
 .
 This package contains the command-line tools.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: GNU troff text-formatting system
 This package contains optional components of the GNU troff text-formatting
 system. The core package, groff-base, contains the traditional tools like
 troff, nroff, tbl, eqn, and pic. This package contains additional devices
 and drivers for output to DVI, HTML (when recommended packages are
 installed - see below), PDF, HP LaserJet printers, and Canon CAPSL LBP-4
 and LBP-8 printers.
 .
 The X75, X75-12, X100, and X100-12 devices, which allow groff output to be
 conveniently viewed on an X display using the standard X11 fonts, are now
 included here. They were previously in a separate package, groff-x11.
 .
 Besides these, the groff package contains man pages describing the language
 and its macro sets, info documentation, and a number of supplementary
 programs:
 .
  - gxditview, which is used to display the output of the X* devices, and
    can also be used to view PostScript output from groff;
  - grn, a preprocessor for pictures in the 'gremlin' format;
  - tfmtodit, which creates font files for use with 'groff -Tdvi';
  - hpftodit, which creates font files for use with 'groff -Tlj4';
  - afmtodit, which creates font files for use with 'groff -Tps';
  - refer, which preprocesses bibliographic references for use with groff;
  - indxbib, which creates inverted indices for bibliographic databases used
    by 'refer';
  - lkbib and lookbib, which search bibliographic databases;
  - addftinfo, which adds metric information to troff font files for use
    with groff;
  - pfbtops, which translates a PostScript font in .pfb format to ASCII for
    use with groff;
  - mmroff, a simple groff preprocessor which expands references in mm;
  - pic2graph, which converts PIC diagrams into cropped image files;
  - eqn2graph, which converts EQN equations into cropped image files;
  - pdfmom, which runs 'groff -mom' to produce PDFs.
 .
 All the standard macro packages are supported.
 .
 Some facilities only work if certain recommended packages are installed:
 .
  - ghostscript, netpbm, psutils: required for HTML output;
  - imagemagick: required for the pic2graph and eqn2graph programs;
  - libpaper1: paper size detection in dvi, lbp, lj4, and ps devices (falls
    back to a4 if not installed);
  - perl: required for PDF output and for the chem preprocessor.

Description: GStreamer plugins from the "bad" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
 to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

Description: GStreamer plugins from the "base" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains the GStreamer plugins from the "base" set, an
 essential exemplary set of elements.

Description: icon theme caching utility
 gtk-update-icon-cache creates mmap()able cache files for icon themes.
 .
 GTK can use the cache files created by gtk-update-icon-cache to avoid a lot
 of system call and disk seek overhead when the application starts. Since the
 format of the cache files allows them to be mmap()ed shared between multiple
 applications, the overall memory consumption is reduced as well.

  * Command line utilities to perform printer maintenance, such as
    ink-level monitoring or pen cleaning and calibration
  * GUI and command line utility to download data from the photo card
    interfaces in MFP devices
  * GUI and command line utilities to interface with the fax functions
  * A GUI toolbox to access all these functions in a friendly way

Description: User space provider drivers for libibverbs
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a
 high-throughput, low-latency networking technology.  InfiniBand host
 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 An RDMA driver consists of a kernel portion and a user space portion.
 This package contains the user space verbs drivers:

Description: Input method configuration framework
 im-config package provides the framework to configure and to switch
 the input method. This input method is the essential mechanism for
 Japanese, Chinese and Korean (CJK) languages to enter their non-ASCII
 native characters.
 .
 Many modern input methods such as IBus support not only one of these CJK
 languages but support almost all languages simultaneously by
 dynamically switching keyboard modes with GUI helper program.
 .
 By installing this package, the most desirable input method and its
 backend conversion engine are automatically configured with both the X
 Window System Input Method (XIM), GTK input method module, Qt input
 method module, and clutter input method module.
 .
 You can further customize your input method with 'im-config' command.

 ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images.
 It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100)
 including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript,
 SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale,
 shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special
 effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and Bézier curves.
 All manipulations can be achieved through shell commands as well as through
 an X11 graphical interface (display).
 .
 For working with the SVG, WMF, OpenEXR, DjVu and Graphviz formats,
 you need to install the libmagickcore-6.q16-7-extra package.
 .
 This version of imagemagick is compiled for a channel
 depth of 16 bits (Q16).

Description: user friendly full screen text editor
 Joe, the Joe's Own Editor, has the feel of most PC text editors: the key
 sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo C editors, but the feature
 set is much larger than of those.  Joe has all of the features a Unix
 user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, complete VI-style Unix
 integration, a powerful configuration file, and regular expression search
 system.  It also has six help reference cards which are always available,
 and an intuitive, simple, and well thought-out user interface.
 .
 Joe has a great screen update optimization algorithm, multiple windows
 (through/between which you can scroll) and lacks the confusing notion of
 named buffers.  It has command history, TAB expansion in file selection
 menus, undo and redo functions, (un)indenting and paragraph formatting,
 filtering highlighted blocks through any external Unix command, editing
 a pipe into or out of a command, and block move, copy, delete or filter.
 .
 Through simple QEdit-style configuration files, Joe can be set up to
 emulate editors such as Pico and Emacs, along with a complete imitation
 of WordStar, and a restricted mode version (lets you edit only the files
 specified on the command line).  Joe also has a deferred screen update to
 handle typeahead, and it ensures that deferral is not bypassed by tty
 buffering.  It's usable even at 2400 baud, and it will work on any
 kind of sane terminal.

 jq can mangle the data format that you have into the

 program to do so is often shorter and simpler than
 you’d expect.

Description: Cross Platform Password Manager
 KeePassXC is a free/open-source password manager or safe which helps you
 to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your
 passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a
 key-disk. So you only have to remember one single master password or
 insert the key-disk to unlock the whole database. The databases are
 encrypted using the algorithms AES or Twofish.
 .
 In contrast to KeePassX (package keepassx), KeePassXC is actively developed
 and has more features, e.g., connectivity to a Web Browser plugin (package
 webext-keepassxc-browser).

Description: process launcher to speed up launching KDE applications
 kdeinit is a process launcher somewhat similar to the
 famous init used for booting UNIX.
 .
 It launches processes by forking and then loading a
 dynamic library which should contain a 'kdemain(...)'
 function.
 .
 Using kdeinit to launch KDE applications makes starting
 a typical KDE applications 2.5 times faster (100ms
 instead of 250ms on a P-III 500) It reduces memory
 consumption by approx. 350Kb per application.

 intended primarily for use with automated or long-running processes and
 support some additional features useful for that purpose, such as running
 as a daemon and refreshing the ticket periodically, checking to see if an
 existing ticket has expired, or obtaining an AFS token along with the
 ticket by running an external program automatically.

 simulations. While floating point representations are not directly
 supported, they can also be efficiently coded by grouping exponents
 and mantissa.

Description: Perl module for merging hierarchies using the C3 algorithm
 The Algorithm::C3 module implements the C3 algorithm.
 .
 C3 is the name of an algorithm which aims to provide a sane method resolution
 order under multiple inheritance. It was first introduced in the language
 Dylan, and then later adopted as the preferred MRO (Method Resolution Order)
 for the new-style classes in Python 2.3. Most recently it has been adopted as
 the 'canonical' MRO for Perl 6 classes, and the default MRO for Parrot
 objects as well.

Description: module to find differences between files
 Algorithm::Diff is a Perl module that allows users to analyze text based on a
 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It can compare two files and find
 the differences between them, which can produce the same information as the
 common Unix tool 'diff'.
 .
 There is an XS-optimized implementation of the core loop, which accelerates
 some types of diff output (see libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl).

Description: module to find differences between files (XS accelerated)
 Algorithm::Diff::XS is a Perl diff utility module based on Joe Schaefer's
 excellent but not very well-known Algorithm::LCS module, with a drop-in
 interface identical to Algorithm::Diff.
 .
 Note that only the LCSidx function is optimized in XS at the moment, which
 means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
 while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as Algorithm::Diff.

 Algorithm::Merge provides three-way merge and diff functions, complementing
 the functionality offered by Algorithm::Diff (libalgorithm-diff-perl). Given
 three sets of items, known as the original, left and right, this module can
 take a three-way difference or merge them. Taking a difference provides an
 array reference that is very similar to the behaviour of Algorithm::Diff. One
 can also implement custom conflict resolution using the CONFLICT callback.

Description: Fortran77 subroutines to solve large scale eigenvalue problems
 ARPACK software is capable of solving large scale symmetric,
 nonsymmetric, and generalized eigenproblems from significant
 application areas. The software is designed to compute a few (k)
 eigenvalues with user specified features such as those of largest
 real part or largest magnitude. Storage requirements are on the order
 of n*k locations. No auxiliary storage is required. A set of Schur
 basis vectors for the desired k-dimensional eigen-space is computed
 which is numerically orthogonal to working precision. Numerically
 accurate eigenvectors are available on request.
 .
 Important Features:
 .
  * Reverse Communication Interface.
  * Single and Double Precision Real Arithmetic Versions for Symmetric,
    Non-symmetric,
  * Standard or Generalized Problems.
  * Single and Double Precision Complex Arithmetic Versions for Standard or
    Generalized Problems.
  * Routines for Banded Matrices - Standard or Generalized Problems.
  * Routines for The Singular Value Decomposition.
  * Example driver routines that may be used as templates to implement
    numerous Shift-Invert strategies for all problem types, data types and
    precision.

Description: Handles arrays of scalars or objects using integer ranges as index
 Array::IntSpan brings the speed advantages of Set::IntSpan to
 arrays. Uses include manipulating grades, routing tables, or any other
 situation where you have mutually exclusive ranges of integers that
 map to given values.
 .
 Array::IntSpan is also able to consolidate ranges
 by comparing the adjacent values of the range. If 2 adjacent values
 are identical, the 2 adjacent ranges are merged.

Description: Authen::SASL - SASL Authentication framework
 SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network
 protocols. Authen::SASL provides an implementation framework that all
 protocols should be able to share.
 .
 The framework allows different implementations of the connection class
 to be plugged in. At the time of writing there were two such plugins:
  - Authen::SASL::Perl
    This module implements several mechanisms and is implemented
    entirely in Perl.
  - Authen::SASL::XS
    This module uses the Cyrus SASL C-library (both version 1 and 2 are
    supported).
  - Authen::SASL::Cyrus
    This module is the predecessor to Authen::SASL::XS. Until version 2.16,
    Authen::SASL::Cyrus was loaded as an alternative to Authen::SASL::XS.

Description: FFmpeg library with functions for simplifying programming - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library is a utility library to aid portable multimedia programming.
 It contains safe portable string functions, random number generators, data
 structures, additional mathematics functions, cryptography and multimedia
 related functionality (like enumerations for pixel and sample formats).
 It is not a library for code needed by both libavcodec and libavformat.
 The goal for this library is to be modular, small, efficient and useful.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

Description: Library for manipulating block devices
 libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be used
 for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM, BTRFS,
 LUKS or MD RAID.
 .
 The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as a thin wrapper around
 its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can be used as
 standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is that it is
 stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has no
 information about VGs when creating an LV).

Description: high performance meta-compressor optimized for binary data
 Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data. It has been
 designed to transmit data to the processor cache faster than the traditional,
 non-compressed, direct memory fetch approach via a memcpy() OS call. Blosc is
 meant not only to reduce the size of large datasets on-disk or in-memory, but
 also to accelerate memory-bound computations.
 .
 It uses the blocking technique to reduce activity on the memory bus as much
 as possible. In short, this technique works by dividing datasets in blocks
 that are small enough to fit in caches of modern processors and perform
 compression / decompression there. It also leverages, if available, SIMD
 instructions (SSE2) and multi-threading capabilities of CPUs, in order to
 accelerate the compression / decompression process to a maximum.

Description: Boost C++ Libraries development files (ALL) (default version)
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 This metapackage provides the complete Boost development environment,
 including all separately-packaged libraries.

Description: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic
 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,
 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number
 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are
 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a
 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and
 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and
 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
 current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time
 spent by the current process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures
 system-CPU time spent by the current process.
  * A tuple-like class
 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU
 process times together.
  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving
 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.
 .

 Boost.Context is a foundational library that provides a sort of
 cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an
 abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread,
 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all
 registers and CPU flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t
 instance represents a specific point in the application's execution
 path. This is useful for building higher-level abstractions, like
 coroutines, cooperative threads (userland threads) or an equivalent
 to C# keyword yield in C++.

Description: provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Context is a foundational library that provides a sort of
 cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an
 abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread,
 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all
 registers and CPU flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t
 instance represents a specific point in the application's execution
 path. This is useful for building higher-level abstractions, like
 coroutines, cooperative threads (userland threads) or an equivalent
 to C# keyword yield in C++.

Description: provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Coroutine provides templates for generalized subroutines which
 allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at
 certain locations. It preserves the local state of execution and
 allows re-entering subroutines more than once (useful if state must
 be kept across function calls).
 .
 Coroutines can be viewed as a language-level construct providing a
 special kind of control flow.
 .
 In contrast to threads, which are pre-emptive, coroutine switches are
 cooperative (programmer controls when a switch will happen). The
 kernel is not involved in the coroutine switches.
 .
 The implementation uses Boost.Context for context switching.

 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.

Description: cooperatively-scheduled micro-/userland-threads (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Fiber provides a framework for micro-/userland-threads (fibers)
 scheduled cooperatively.  The API contains classes and functions to
 manage and synchronize fibers similarly to standard thread support
 library.
 .
 Each fiber has its own stack.
 .
 A fiber can save the current execution state, including all registers
 and CPU flags, the instruction pointer, and the stack pointer and
 later restore this state. The idea is to have multiple execution
 paths running on a single thread using cooperative scheduling (versus
 threads, which are preemptively scheduled). The running fiber decides
 explicitly when it should yield to allow another fiber to run
 (context switching). Boost.Fiber internally uses execution_context
 from Boost.Context; the classes in this library manage, schedule and,
 when needed, synchronize those execution contexts. A context switch
 between threads usually costs thousands of CPU cycles on x86,
 compared to a fiber switch with less than a hundred cycles. A fiber
 runs on a single thread at any point in time.

 .
 The Parallel Boost Graph Library is an extension to the Boost Graph Library
 (BGL) for parallel and distributed computing. It offers distributed graphs
 and graph algorithms to exploit coarse-grained parallelism along with
 parallel algorithms that exploit fine-grained parallelism, while retaining
 the same interfaces as the (sequential) BGL. Code written using the sequential
 BGL should be easy to parallelize with the parallel BGL.

Description: generic graph components and algorithms in C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Graphs are mathematical abstractions that are useful for solving
 many types of problems in computer science. Consequently, these
 abstractions must also be represented in computer programs. A
 standardized generic interface for traversing graphs is of utmost
 importance to encourage reuse of graph algorithms and data structures.

 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.83).

Description: Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP library
 The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is designed to improve
 headphone listening of stereo audio records.
 .
 Typical stereo recordings are made for listening with speakers.
 What's missing in headphones is the sound going from each channel
 to the opposite ear, arriving a short time later for the extra distance
 traveled, and with a bit of high frequency roll-off for the shadowing
 effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be
 somewhat longer at low frequencies than at high frequencies. bs2b
 implements both of these ideas to transform stereophonic recordings
 for headphone listening.

Description: Java scripting environment (BeanShell) Version 2 (library)
 BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter with object
 scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell executes standard Java
 statements and expressions, in addition to obvious scripting commands and
 syntax.  BeanShell supports scripted objects as simple method closures like
 those in Perl and JavaScript(tm).
 .
 You can use BeanShell interactively for Java experimentation and debugging or
 as a simple scripting engine for you applications.  In short: BeanShell is a
 dynamically interpreted Java, plus some useful stuff.
 .
 This package contains the Java library without the command line tools.

Description: Perl extension to generate cryptographically-secure random bytes
 Bytes::Random::Secure provides two interfaces for obtaining crypt-quality
 random bytes. The simple interface is built around plain functions. For
 greater control over the Random Number Generator's seeding, there is an
 Object Oriented interface that provides much more flexibility.
 .
 The "functions" interface provides five functions that can be used any time
 you need a string (or MIME Base64 representation, or hex-digits
 representation, or Quoted Printable representation) of a specific number of
 random bytes. There are equivalent methods available via the OO interface.
 .
 Bytes::Random::Secure can be a drop-in replacement for Bytes::Random, with
 the primary enhancement of using a much higher quality random number
 generator to create the random data. The random_bytes function emulates the
 user interface of Bytes::Random's function by the same name. But with
 Bytes::Random::Secure the random number generator comes from
 Math::Random::ISAAC, and is suitable for cryptographic purposes. The harder
 problem to solve is how to seed the generator. This module uses
 Crypt::Random::Seed to generate the initial seeds for Math::Random::ISAAC.

Description: library for common operations with sizes in bytes
 Many projects need to work with sizes in bytes (be it sizes of storage
 space, memory, ...) and all of them need to deal with the same issues
 like:
 .
  * How to get a human-readable string for the given size?
  * How to store the given size so that no significant information is lost?
  * How to handle sizes bigger than MAXUINT64?
  * How to interpret sizes entered by users according to their locale and
    typing conventions?
  * How to deal with the decimal/binary units (MB vs. MiB) ambiguity?
 .
 This library aims to be as much generally usable as possible, small, fast and
 be easily interfaced from other languages.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, data compressor.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Perl interface to the Cairo graphics library
 libcairo-perl provides access to the Cairo library.
 .
 Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple
 output devices. It is designed to produce consistent output
 on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware
 acceleration when available (eg. through the X Render Extension).
 .
 The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing
 operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including
 stroking and filling cubic Bézier splines, transforming and compositing
 translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing
 operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale,
 rotation, shear, etc.)
 .

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased

 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.
 .

Description: Perl module to accelerate Class::C3
 Class::C3::XS is a Perl module designed to enhance the performance of the
 Class::C3 package (see libclass-c3-perl). It does so automatically and is not
 designed to be used directly; once installed, it should accelerate all programs
 that make use of Class::C3 itself.

Description: Perl module to create accessors to class data
 Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating accessors/mutators to class
 data.  That is, if you want to store something about your class as a
 whole (instead of about a single object).  This data is then inherited
 by your subclasses and can be overridden.
 .
 For example:
 .
 Pere::Ubu->mk_classdata('Suitcase');
 .
 will generate the method Suitcase() in the class Pere::Ubu.
 .
 This new method can be used to get and set a piece of class data.
 .
 Pere::Ubu->Suitcase('Red');
 $suitcase = Pere::Ubu->Suitcase;

Description: Perl module providing method modifiers
 Class::Method::Modifiers provides three modifiers: before, around, and after.
 The before and after modifiers are run just before and after the method they
 modify, but cannot really affect that original method. The remaining modifier,
 around, is run in place of the original method, with a hook to easily call the
 original method.

Description: Perl module providing fast XS accessors
 Class::XSAccessor implements fast XS accessors both for getting at and setting
 an object attribute. Additionally, the module supports mutators and simple
 predicates like those for testing the truth value of a variable. It works only
 with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes.
 .
 The XS accessor methods were between 1.6 and 2.5 times faster than typical
 pure-perl accessors in some simple benchmarking. If you usually write clear
 code, a factor of two speed-up is a good estimate.
 .
 Refer to Class::XSAccessor::Array (also included in libclass-xsaccessor-perl)
 for an implementation that works with array-based objects.

Description: module for recursively copying Perl datatypes
 The Clone module provides a clone() method which makes recursive copies of
 nested hash, array, scalar and reference types, including tied variables and
 objects.
 .
 It is faster (although less flexible) than Storable's dclone. Its
 functionality is _not_ serializing in-memory objects (i.e. as
 Data::Dumper or YAML::Dump do), but deep-copying them over to new
 in-memory structures.

 As this is the n-th-something JSON module on CPAN, what was the reason to
 write yet another JSON module? While it seems there are many JSON modules,
 none of them correctly handle all corner cases, and in most cases their
 maintainers are unresponsive, gone missing, or not listening to bug reports
 for other reasons.

 .
 It should be noted that the RC4 algorithm itself is severely broken, and the
 upstream Perl module has not been updated since Dec 2001. It is included in
 Debian only because it is needed by other packages. In general this package
 should not be used for new projects, and where it is used appropriate
 defensive methods should be understood and applied.

 The Crypt::SSLeay package contains Net::SSL, which is automatically
 loaded by LWP::Protocol::https on HTTPS requests, and provides the
 necessary SSL glue for that module to work via these deprecated modules:
 Crypt::SSLeay::CTX, Crypt::SSLeay::Conn and Crypt::SSLeay::X509.
 .
 Work on Crypt::SSLeay has been continued only to provide HTTPS support
 for the LWP - libwww perl libraries. If you want access to the OpenSSL
 API via perl, check out Sampo's Net::SSLeay (available in Debian as
 the libnet-ssleay-perl package).

Description: lightweight C library for daemons - runtime library
 libdaemon is a lightweight C library which eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
 It consists of the following parts:
 .
  * Wrapper around fork() for correct daemonization of a process
  * Wrapper around syslog() for simple log output to syslog or STDERR
  * An API for writing PID files
  * An API for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll()
  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 .
 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It
 is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable.
 .
 This package includes the libdaemon run time shared library.

 code that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original arguments. The
 string is formatted for easy reading.
 .
 If called in void context, the dump is printed on standard error instead of
 being returned. If you don't like importing a function that overrides Perl's
 not-so-useful builtin, then you can also import the same function as "pp"
 (the mnemonic for "pretty-print").

Description: Perl library for accessing dates
 Date::Calc is a Perl module which provides a variety of date calculations
 based on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in Western countries today),
 complying with the ISO/R 2015-1971 and DIN 1355 standards which specify
 things such as what leap years are, when they occur, how the week numbers
 are defined, what's the first day of the week, how many weeks (52 or 53) a
 given year has, and so on.
 .
 Although the Gregorian calendar was only adopted 1582 by most (not all)
 European countries (some countries continued to use the Julian calendar
 until as late as the beginning of the 20th century!), this package allows
 you to extrapolate the Gregorian calendar back until the year 1.
 .
 If Date::Calc::XS (libdate-calc-xs-perl) is available, this package will
 automatically accelerate its operation using the C/XS implementation.

 operation easily, though not necessarily quickly. There are other modules
 that can do a small subset of these operations quicker, so if speed is a
 primary issue, you should look elsewhere.

Description: Perl DBI driver with a self-contained RDBMS
 DBD::SQLite is a Perl DBI driver with a self-contained relational database

 called SQLite (see sqlite3) into a DBI driver. It is useful if you want a
 relational database for your project, but don't want to install a large
 RDBMS system like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
 .
 SQLite supports the following features:
 .
  * Implements a large subset of SQL92 (<URL:http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html>)
  * A complete DB in a single disk file
    Everything for your database is stored in a single disk file, making it
    easier to move things around than with DBD::CSV.
  * Atomic commit and rollback
 .
 The engine is very fast, but for updates/inserts/dml it does perform a global
 lock on the entire database. This, obviously, might not be good for multiple
 user systems. The database also appears to be significantly faster if your
 transactions are coarse.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

Description: configuration to enable the Debian debug info server
 This package asks if it should enable use of the Debian debug info
 server with debugging tools that use libdebuginfo such as GDB.
 .
 When this is allowed by the sysadmin, a snippet will be added to the
 shell configuration. You will need to restart your shell after
 installing this package before the snippet will work.
 .
 The Debian debug info server will be contacted every time debugging
 tools attempt to look up debug info for binaries or libraries but the
 server does not log requests for debug info.
 .
 The Debian debug info server uses https to securely transfer debugging
 files but does not offer OpenPGP signing of debug info.

Description: custom op checking attached to subroutines
 Devel::CallChecker makes some new features of the Perl 5.14.0 C API
 available to XS modules running on older versions of Perl.
 The features are centred around the function cv_set_call_checker,
 which allows XS code to attach a magical annotation
 to a Perl subroutine,
 resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine
 being mutated at compile time by arbitrary C code.
 This module makes cv_set_call_checker
 and several supporting functions available.
 (It is possible to achieve the effect of cv_set_call_checker
 from XS code on much earlier Perl versions,
 but it is painful to achieve without the centralised facility.)

Depends: perl:any, libmodule-runtime-perl
Description: module for declaring version conflicts for a distribution
 One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
 way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules.
 Dist::CheckConflicts attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to
 specify conflicting versions of modules separately, and deal with them after
 the module is done installing.
 .
 For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo.
 If Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would
 cause Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just
 depend on the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular
 dependency (because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't
 express intent properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal
 solution would be for there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of
 modules in a way that would let CPAN clients update conflicting modules
 automatically after an existing module is upgraded, but until that happens,
 this module will allow users to do this manually.

Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),

Description: Perl module to safely and cleanly create closures via string eval
 String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose
 uses it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors,
 which speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not
 without its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in
 (which determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can
 be quite slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.
 .
 Eval::Closure attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
 eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other
 than a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the
 eval, so that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
 environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of
 the string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if
 caching is to work properly).

 representing a filehandle to read the directory listing from.
 .
 The second parameter is the time zone to use when parsing time stamps in the
 listing. If this value is undefined, then the local time zone is assumed.
 .
 The third parameter is the type of listing to assume. Currently supported
 formats are 'unix', 'apache' and 'dosftp'. The default value 'unix'.

 build product, when the build process itself cannot be made deterministic.
 .
 It is used as part of the Reproducible Builds project, although it should be
 considered a temporary workaround which should not be needed in the long
 term; upstream software should be reproducible even without using such a tool.

 This package installs the Perl module ‘File::StripNondeterminism’.

 Flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognized lexical
 patterns in text. It reads the given input files for a description of a
 scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular
 expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates as output a C source
 file, lex.yy.c, which defines a routine yylex().  This file is compiled
 and linked with the -lfl library to produce an executable. When the
 executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of the regular
 expressions. Whenever it finds one, it executes the corresponding C code.

 It supports a wide range of DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32/40/48,
 and BGA chips, which use various protocols such as LPC, FWH, parallel
 flash, or SPI.
 .
 The tool can be used to flash BIOS/firmware images for example -- be it
 proprietary BIOS images or coreboot (previously known as LinuxBIOS) images.
 .
 It can also be used to read the current existing BIOS/firmware from a
 flash chip.

Description: Optimise Linux system performance on demand (host library)
 GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set
 of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS.
 .
 The design has a clear-cut abstraction between the host daemon and library
 (gamemoded and libgamemode), and the client loaders (libgamemodeauto and
 gamemode_client.h) that allows for safe use without worrying about whether
 the daemon is installed or running. This design also means that while the
 host library currently relies on systemd for exchanging messages with the
 daemon, it's entirely possible to implement other internals that still work
 with the same clients.
 .
 GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with
 the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is intended to
 be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are a wealth of
 automation tasks one might want to apply.
 .
 This package provides the host library for gamemode. It is an internal
 library which communicates with the daemon.

Description: conservative garbage collector for C and C++
 Boehm-Demers-Weiser's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator that is
 intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc or C++'s new().
 .
 It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would without
 explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector
 automatically recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be
 used.
 .
 This version of the collector is thread safe, has C++ support and uses the
 defaults for everything else. However, it does not work as a drop-in malloc(3)
 replacement.

Description: GObject based collection and utility library
 libgee is a collection library providing GObject-based interfaces and
 classes for commonly used data structures.
 .
 libgee provides the following interfaces:
  * Traversable
    - Iterable
         + Collection
           # List
             * BidirList
           # Set
             * SortedSet
               - BidirSortedSet
           # MultiSet
           # Queue
             * Deque
         + Map
           # SortedMap
             * BidirSortedMap
    - Iterator
         + BidirIterator
           # BidirListIterator
         + ListIterator
           # BidirListIterator
  * MultiMap
  * Future
 .
 The ArrayList, ArrauQueue, ConcurrentLinkedList, ConcurrentSet, HashSet,
 HashMap, HashMultiSet, HashMultiMap, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, Promise,
 TreeSet, TreeMap, TreeMultiSet, and TreeMultiMap classes provide a
 reasonable sample implementation of those interfaces. In addition, a set of
 abstract classes are provided to ease the implementation of new collections.
 .
 Around that, the API provides means to retrieve read-only views, efficient
 sort algorithms, simple, bi-directional or index-based mutable iterators
 depending on the collection type.
 .
 libgee is written in Vala and can be used like any GObject-based C library.
 It's planned to provide bindings for further languages.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

Version: 1.4.2+dfsg1-2build1
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.29), libgl1
Description: Lib providing high quality vector output for OpenGL application
 GL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any OpenGL
 application. The main difference between GL2PS and other similar libraries
 is the use of sorting algorithms capable of handling intersecting and
 stretched polygons, as well as non manifold objects. GL2PS provides advanced
 smooth shading and text rendering, culling of invisible primitives, mixed
 vector/bitmap output, and much more...
 .
 GL2PS can currently create PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS),
 Portable Document Format (PDF) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files,
 as well as LATEX files for the text fragments. GL2PS also provides limited,
 experimental support for Portable LaTeX Graphics (PGF). Adding new vector
 output formats should be relatively easy; you can also use the excellent
 pstoedit program to transform the PostScript files generated by GL2PS into
 many other vector formats such as xfig, cgm, wmf, etc.

Description: Development files for the GLib library
 GLib is a library containing many useful C routines for things such
 as trees, hashes, lists, and strings.  It is a useful general-purpose
 C library used by projects such as GTK+, GIMP, and GNOME.
 .
 This package is needed to compile programs against libglib2.0-0t64,
 as only it includes the header files and static libraries (optionally)
 needed for compiling.
 .
 GObject-Introspection metadata for this library can be found in the
 libgirepository1.0-dev package.

 syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization from
 Silicon Graphics, Inc.  However, the authors make no claim that Mesa
 is in any way a compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with
 Silicon Graphics, Inc.
 .
 This version of Mesa provides GLX and DRI capabilities: it is capable of
 both direct and indirect rendering.  For direct rendering, it can use DRI
 modules from the libgl1-mesa-dri package to accelerate drawing.
 .
 This package does not include the modules themselves: these can be found
 in the libgl1-mesa-dri package.

 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, this implementation turns frames of
 160 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: GStreamer development files for libraries from the "base" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains development files for GStreamer libraries from
 the "base" set, an essential exemplary set of elements.

Description: handling and rendering XPS documents (library)
 OpenXPS or XPS stands for XML Paper Specification. It is based on XML and it's
 a new electronic paper format originally developed by Microsoft and it serves
 as a PDF alternative. XPS files are usually created using "Microsoft XPS
 Document Writer" in Windows environments. It is now standardized as an open
 standard document format.
 .
 Quoting Wikipedia:
 An XPS file is in fact a Unicoded ZIP archive using the Open Packaging
 Conventions, containing the files which make up the document. These include an
 XML markup file for each page, text, embedded fonts, raster images, 2D vector
 graphics, as well as the digital rights management information. The contents
 of an XPS file can be examined simply by opening it in an application which
 supports ZIP files.
 .
 The OpenXPS document format specification supports features such as color
 gradients, transparencies, CMYK color spaces, printer calibration,
 multiple-ink systems and print schemas.
 .
 This package contains the library. It is being used by evince to read XPS
 documents.

Description: Hierarchical Data Format library (without NetCDF)
 HDF is a multi-object file format for storing and transferring
 graphical and numerical data mainly used in scientific computing. HDF
 supports several different data models, including multidimensional
 arrays, raster images, and tables. Each defines a specific aggregate
 data type and provides an API for reading, writing, and organizing the
 data and metadata. New data models can be added by the HDF developers
 or users.
 .
 This package contains the HDF run-time libraries which do not
 collide with the NetCDF library namespace. Fortran functions
 are missing in this flavor of the library set.

Description: low level cryptographic library (public-key cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

 The HP Linux Printing and Imaging System provides full support for

 LaserJets, and for scanning, sending faxes and for photo-card access on
 most HP MFP (multi-function peripheral) printers.
 .
 Shared library that provides direct I/O for each process. Prior to
 hpmud, all I/O was serialized through hpiod, a monolithic I/O processor.
 The new hpmud direct I/O is faster. Hpmud supports parallel, USB and
 JetDirect connectivity.
 .
 With hpmud, HPLIP no longer has Linux specific libusb extensions. This
 means any UNIX/Linux derivative that supports libusb may work with
 HPLIP. A public HPLIP "C" API is exposed through hpmud. See hpmud.h
 for documentation. A Python wrapper for hpmud, called hpmudext, is also
 available.

Description: HTTP cookie jars
 This class is for objects that represent a "cookie jar" -- that is, a

 .
 Cookies are a general mechanism which server side connections can use to both
 store and retrieve information on the client side of the connection. For more
 information about cookies refer to
 <URL:http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html> and
 <URL:http://www.cookiecentral.com/>. HTTP::Cookies also implements the new
 style cookies described in RFC 2965. The two variants of cookies are supposed
 to be able to coexist happily.
 .
 Instances of the class HTTP::Cookies are able to store a collection of
 Set-Cookie2: and Set-Cookie: headers and are able to use this information to
 initialize Cookie-headers in HTTP::Request objects. The state of a
 HTTP::Cookies object can be saved in and restored from files.

Description: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::IP, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::IP subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Description: perl interface to HTTP style messages
 The HTTP::Message distribution contains classes useful for representing the

 The HTTP::Headers class encapsulates HTTP-style message headers. The headers
 consist of attribute-value pairs also called fields, which may be repeated,
 and which are printed in a particular order. The field names are cases
 insensitive.
 .
 Instances of this class are usually created as member variables of the
 HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response classes, internal to the library.

 The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,
 MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and
 transmission. It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which
 transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also
 represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for
 these media types thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel
 modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug
 control registers and connection management that previously existed in
 experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.

Description: module for importing packages into other packages
 Import::Into creates a global method import::into which you can call on
 any package to import it into another package. This is useful because
 there are many different ways to write exporters: some use Exporter, some
 use Sub::Exporter, some use Moose::Exporter, some use Exporter::Declare
 and some things are pragmas.
 .
 And if you want to re-export other things, you have to know which is which.
 Exporter subclasses provide export_to_level, but if they overrode their
 import method all bets are off. Sub::Exporter provides an into parameter
 but figuring out something used it isn't trivial. Pragmas need to have
 their import method called directly since they affect the current unit of
 compilation. Import::Into can be used to import packages into other packages
 without having to deal with the specific details of every exporting approach.

Description: module warning about using the indirect object syntax
 When enabled (or disabled as some may prefer to say, since you actually turn
 it on by calling no indirect), the indirect pragma lexically warns about
 indirect object syntax constructs that may have slipped into your code. This
 syntax is now considered harmful, since its parsing has many quirks and its
 use is error prone (when swoosh isn't defined, swoosh $x actually compiles to
 $x->swoosh).
 .
 It currently does not warn for core functions (print, say, exec or system).
 This may change in the future, or may be added as optional features that
 would be enabled by passing options to unimport.
 .
 indirect is not a source filter.

Description: Perl implementation of iterators
 Iterator is meant to be the definitive implementation of iterators, as
 popularized by Mark Jason Dominus's lectures and recent book (Higher Order
 Perl, Morgan Kauffman, 2005).
 .
 An "iterator" is an object, represented as a code block that generates the
 "next value" of a sequence, and generally implemented as a closure. When you
 need a value to operate on, you pull it from the iterator. If it depends on
 other iterators, it pulls values from them when it needs to. Iterators can be
 chained together (see Iterator::Util for functions that help you do just
 that), queueing up work to be done but not actually doing it until a value is
 needed at the front end of the chain. At that time, one data value is pulled
 through the chain.

 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,

 For web developers, JPEG XR has a large number of interesting features, see
 the table below. Some of these are big advantages over other image formats
 like JPEG, PNG, OpenEXR, and TIFF.
  - Better Compression (40% smaller than JPEG)
  - Lossless Mode (better compression than PNG)
  - Alpha Channel (compress color lossy and alpha losslessly)
  - Extended Bitdepth (supports 8-, 16-, and 32-bit/channel)
  - Progressive Decode
  - Advanced Decoding Features (tile-based layout, for efficient
    region-of-interest access.)

 KConfigGui provides a way to hook widgets to the configuration so
 that they are automatically initialized from the configuration and
 automatically propagate their changes to their respective
 configuration files.

Description: Advanced internationalization framework.
 Ki18n is the KDE internationalization system for
 user-interface text. It enables localization of
 user-visible strings, including locale-aware argument
 substitution and formatting. Ki18n is built atop the
 widely used Gettext internationalization system, making
 the workflow familiar to both programmers and translators.
 It can be considered a Gettext-wrapper for code based on
 the Qt library, but it also provides additional
 functionality over basic Gettext.

Description: image processing library
 Well-tested C library for some basic image processing operations,
 along with a description of the functions and some design methods. A
 full set of affine transformations (translation, shear, rotation,
 scaling) on images of all depths is included, with the exception that
 some of the scaling methods do not work at all depths. There are also
 implementations of binary morphology, grayscale morphology,
 convolution and rank order filters, and applications such as jbig2
 image processing and color quantization. You will also find basic
 utilities for the safe and efficient handling of arrays (of strings,
 numbers, number pairs and image-related geometrical objects), byte
 queues, generic stacks, generic lists, and endian-independent
 indexing into 32-bit arrays.

 Log::Any allows CPAN modules to safely and efficiently log messages, while
 letting the application choose (or decline to choose) a logging mechanism
 such as Log::Dispatch or Log::Log4perl.
 .
 Log::Any has a very tiny footprint and no dependencies beyond Perl 5.6, which
 makes it appropriate for even small CPAN modules to use. It defaults to
 'null' logging activity, so a module can safely log without worrying about
 whether the application has chosen (or will ever choose) a logging mechanism.
 .
 The application, in turn, may choose one or more logging mechanisms via
 Log::Any::Adapter.

 object and particularly for creating new outputs.

Description: Perl port of the widely popular log4j logging package
 Log::Log4perl is a pure Perl port of the widely popular Apache/Jakarta
 log4j library for Java. In the spirit of log4j, Log::Log4perl
 addresses the shortcomings of typical ad-hoc or homegrown logging
 systems by providing three mechanisms to control the amount of data
 being logged and where it ends up at:
    * Levels allow you to specify the priority of log
      messages. Low-priority messages are suppressed when the system's
      setting allows for only higher-priority messages.
    * Categories define which parts of the system you want to enable
      logging in. Category inheritance allows you to elegantly reuse
      and override previously defined settings of different parts in the
      category hierarchy. So, at a central location in your system (either
      in a configuration file or in the startup code) you may specify which
      components (classes, functions) of your system should generate logs.
    * Appenders allow you to choose which output devices the log data
      is being written to, once it clears the previously listed
      hurdles.

Description: converts plain array images into multi-size representation
 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
 non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
 .
 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
 them to a multi-size representation.
 .
 Following is a list of features:
 .
   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out
     later without any further processing
   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically
     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
     successive steps without wasting computational time
   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
     less connected, or more rigid, or both
   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
     as the parent image
   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
     selecting among different energy gradient functions
   * Reports progress through a customizable interface
   * A signalling system permits one to cleanly handle errors
 .
 The library implements the algorithm described in the paper "Seam
 Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Shai Avidan and Ariel
 Shamir, which can be found at
 http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/imret.pdf
 .

 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.

 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.

 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN

Version: 0.11.1-1ubuntu1.2
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.4), libglib2.0-0t64 (>= 2.79.0)
Description: library for parental control of applications
 malcontent implements support for restricting the type of content accessible
 to non-administrator accounts on a Linux system. Typically, when this is used,
 a non-administrator account will be for a child using the system; and the
 administrator accounts will be for the parents; and the content being filtered
 will be apps which are not suitable for the child to use, due to (for example)
 being too violent.
 .
 This is not a security boundary, and a sufficiently technically advanced user
 may always work around these parental controls. malcontent is not a mandatory
 access control (MAC) system like AppArmor or SELinux. However, its correct use
 by applications should provide enough of an obstacle to prevent users easily or
 accidentally having access to content which they shouldn’t.
 .
 This package contains the libmalcontent library.

Description: Perl extension for base 85 numbers, as referenced by RFC 1924
 RFC 1924 describes a compact, fixed-size representation of IPv6 addresses
 which uses a base 85 number system. Math::Base85 handles some of the uglier
 details of it.
 .
 The base 85 numbers (from 0 to 84) are as follows:
 .
 0..9 A..Z a..z ! # $ % & ( ) * + - ; < = > ? @ ^ _ ` { | } ~
 .
 At the moment, there's not much in this module. But it should be sufficient
 for the purposes of RFC 1924.
 .
 This module has a variable called $Math::Base85::base85_digits, which is a
 string containing the digits of the base 85 alphabet from lowest (0) to
 highest (~), in that order.

Description: Perl interface to the ISAAC PRNG Algorithm
 Math::Random::ISAAC implements the ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add
 and Count) pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm described on the
 project page at: <URL:http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html>
 .
 As with other algorithms like the Mersenne Twister (see Math::Random::MT),
 this algorithm is designed to take some seed information and produce seemingly
 random results as output.
 .
 The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased, and unpredictable unless you
 know the seed. The algorithm was published by Bob Jenkins in the late 1990s
 and despite the best efforts of many security researchers, no feasible attacks
 have been found to date.
 .
 For comparison with other algorithms intended to generate random data, the
 Mersenne Twister has a period of 2^19937-1, the related TT800 has a period
 of 2^800-1 values. ISAAC has a period of 2^8295 values on average.

 in his paper at: <URL:http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html>

 If you install this package, then any code that uses Math::Random::ISAAC will
 automagically benefit from this faster implementation. Performance increases
 are somewhere on the order of 400-500%.

 .
 Compactness: MD4C is implemented in one source file and one header file.
 .
 Embedding: MD4C is easy to reuse in other projects, its API is very
 straightforward: There is actually just one function, md_parse().
 .
 Push model: MD4C parses the complete document and calls callback functions
 provided by the application for each start/end of block, start/end of a span,
 and with any textual contents.
 .
 Portability: MD4C builds and works on Windows and Linux, and it should
 be fairly simple to make it run also on most other systems.
 .
 Encoding: MD4C can be compiled to recognize ASCII-only control characters,
 UTF-8 and, on Windows, also UTF-16, i.e. what is on Windows commonly
 called just "Unicode". See more details below.
 .
 Permissive license: MD4C is available under the MIT license.

 solution to support the "Internet Gateway Device" part of the protocol. The
 MediaServer/MediaRenderer UPnP protocol is also becoming very popular.
 .
 Miniupnpc aims at the simplest library possible, with the smallest footprint
 and no dependencies to other libraries such as XML parsers or HTTP
 implementations. All the code is pure ANSI C. Compiled on a x86 PC, the
 miniupnp client library have less than 15KB code size. For instance, the upnpc
 sample program is around 20KB. The miniupnp daemon is much smaller than any
 other IGD daemon and is ideal for using on low memory device for this reason.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

    fastest library around for what it does.

  * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific
    optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back
    on.  This should be portable to all architectures - at least it is known
    people run this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.
 .
  * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific
    code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very
    diverse projects.
 .
 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

Description: module to remove imported symbols after compilation
 namespace::autoclean is a Perl pragma that keeps your namespace clean by
 removing all imported symbols at the end of the current package's compile
 cycle. Perhaps most importantly, this means that imported functions will no
 longer be made accidentally accessible to users outside of your package via
 method invocations.
 .
 This module differs from namespace::clean (see libnamespace-clean-perl) in
 that it cleans all imported functions, whether or not the imports happened
 prior to using the pragma. Things that "look" like a method (according to
 Class::MOP) will be left alone.

Description: module for keeping imports and functions out of the current namespace
 namespace::clean is a Perl pragma for keeping imported functions out of the
 current namespace. This is especially important because Perl functions are
 naturally available as methods, which can complicate subclassing.
 .
 Using the namespace::clean pragma will remove all previously declared or
 imported symbols at the end of the current package's compile cycle. This
 means that functions called in the package itself will still be bound by
 their name, but they won't show up as methods on your class or instances.

 implementation of the protocol NAT-PMP for the client side. It is based on non
 blocking sockets and all calls of the API are asynchronous. It is therefore
 very easy to integrate the NAT-PMP code to any event driven code.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or

 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

Description: Software implementation of the OpenAL audio API (shared library)

 vendor-neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily spatialized
 audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop
 users that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other
 multimedia applications.
 .
 This library is meant as a compatible update/replacement to the OpenAL Sample
 Implementation (the SI). The SI has been unmaintained for quite a while, and
 would require a lot of work to clean up. This is a fork the old Windows version
 to attempt an accelerated ALSA version of an OpenAL implementation.
 .
 OpenAL Soft supports mono, stereo, 4-channel, 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 output, as
 opposed to the SI's 4-channel max (though it did have some provisions for 6
 channel, this was not 5.1, and was seemingly a "late" addition). OpenAL Soft
 does not support the Vorbis and MP3 extensions, however those were considered
 deprecated even in the SI. It does, though, support some of the newer
 extensions like AL_EXT_FLOAT32 and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS for multi-channel and
 floating-point formats, as well as ALC_EXT_EFX for environmental audio effects,
 and others.
 .
 This package installs the OpenAL Soft shared library.

Description: runtime files for the OpenEXR image library
 OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
 Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
 .
 OpenEXR's features include:
    * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and
      10-bit image file formats.
    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the
      included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on
      images with film grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
      be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
      software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
      integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
      affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
      applications.
 .
 This package contains the following shared library:
    * IlmImf - a library that reads and writes OpenEXR images.

Description: module to inspect and manipulate lexical variables
 PadWalker is a module that allows you to inspect and even modify lexical
 variables in the current "lexical pad stack." Perl tracks which variables
 are accessible and visible in each lexical scope by keeping a separate
 set of variables for each scope. This module looks for a given variable
 by traversing that stack, which allows it to alter anything in the stack,
 even variables not normally accessible in the current scope.
 .
 In practise, this module is useful for checking anything defined in the full
 stack of subroutines that called your function, making it extremely useful
 for debugging. It is, however, not recommended for use in production code.

Description: Perl module for argument type classification
 Params::Classify provides various type-testing functions. These are intended
 for functions that, unlike most Perl code, care what type of data they
 are operating on. For example, some functions wish to behave
 differently depending on the type of their arguments (like overloaded
 functions in C++).
 .
 These functions only provide type classification; they do not enforce
 type restrictions. Type enforcement may, of course, be built using
 these classification functions, but the reader's attention is drawn to
 libparams-validate-perl.

Description: module to build an optimized subroutine parameter validator
 Params::ValidationCompiler creates a customized, highly efficient parameter
 checking subroutine. It can handle named or positional parameters, and can
 return the parameters as key/value pairs or a list of values.
 .
 In addition to type checks, it also supports parameter defaults, optional
 parameters, and extra "slurpy" parameters.
 .
 A parameter specification can be provided as either an arrayref (which expects
 positional params) or a hashref (which expects named params). Parameter types
 can be specified as Moose, Type::Tiny or Specio type objects. Parameters can
 be specified as being optional and can be provided with default values.

Description: iterative, recursive file finder
 Path::Iterator::Rule iterates over files and directories
 to identify ones matching a user-defined set of rules.
 The API is based heavily on File::Find::Rule,
 but with more explicit distinction between matching rules
 and options that influence how directories are searched.
 A Path::Iterator::Rule object is a collection of rules (match criteria)
 with methods to add additional criteria.
 Options that control directory traversal are given as arguments
 to the method that generates an iterator.
 .
 Here is a summary of features
 for comparison to other file finding modules:
  * provides many "helper" methods for specifying rules
  * offers (lazy) iterator and flattened list interfaces
  * custom rules implemented with callbacks
  * breadth-first (default) or pre- or post-order depth-first searching
  * follows symlinks (by default, but can be disabled)
  * directories visited only once (no infinite loop; can be disabled)
  * doesn't chdir during operation
  * provides an API for extensions
 .
 As a convenience, the PIR module is an empty subclass of this one
 that is less arduous to type for one-liners.

 It doesn't attempt to be as full-featured as IO::All or Path::Class,
 nor does it try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32

 obscure or tortuous. (Quick! What does this mean:
 "///../../..//./././a//b/.././c/././"? And how does it differ on
 Win32?)

Description: OpenPGM shared library
 OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast
 (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable
 and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss,
 request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of
 unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the
 receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the
 sender of reception responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram
 service, currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
 switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.
 .
 This is the runtime package for programs that use the OpenPGM library.

 "Pod::Parser", which provides a base class for parsing and selecting sections
 of POD documentation from an input stream.
 .
 "Pod::Select", which provides a subclass of Pod::Parser and an exported
 function named "podselect()" to dump selected sections of raw pod
 documentation from an input stream.
 .
 "Pod::PlainText", which is a replacement for "Pod::Text" and the
 corresponding "pod2text()" function. It is derived from the Pod::Parser
 class. As of perl 5.00_58, Pod::PlainText has been re-written by Russ
 Allbery, and has been renamed to Pod::Text in the core Perl distribution
 (replacing the previous implementation of Pod::Text). The Pod::PlainText
 module is still provided with Pod::Parser solely for backward
 compatibility.
 .
 "Pod::InputObjects": Some input objects needed by Pod::Parser, and for
 advanced users of Pod::Parser that need more about a command besides its name
 and text.
 .
 "Pod::ParseUtils", a module with several object-oriented helpers for POD
 parsing and processing. Probably the most important is Pod::Hyperlink for
 parsing and expanding POD hyperlinks L<...>.
 .
 This distribution is considered to be legacy - it has been superseded by
 Pod::Simple which brings more robustness, unicode and various other benefits.
 It has been removed from perl core after 5.31.0, and is packaged only for
 backward compatibility.

Description: protocol buffers C++ library
 Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
 serializing structured data - similar to XML, but smaller, faster, and
 simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
 use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
 data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
 You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
 that are compiled against the "old" format.
 .
 Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and
 file formats.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library needed for C++ applications.

Description: pthread stubs not provided by native libc, development files
 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided
 in libc or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely
 on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
 linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.
 .
 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

 QPDF is a program that can be used to linearize (web-optimize),
 encrypt (password-protect), decrypt, and inspect PDF files from the
 command-line.  It does these and other structural, content-preserving
 transformations on PDF files, reading a PDF file as input and
 creating a new one as output.  It also provides many useful
 capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people
 who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more
 about how they work.
 .
 QPDF understands PDF files that use compressed object streams
 (supported by newer PDF applications) and can convert such files into
 those that can be read with older viewers.  It can also be used for
 checking PDF files for structural errors, inspecting stream contents,
 or extracting objects from PDF files.  QPDF is not PDF content
 creation or viewing software -- it does not have the capability to
 create PDF files from scratch or to display PDF files.
 .
 This package contains the qpdf runtime libraries required to run
 programs that link with the qpdf library.

Description: Library for managing RDMA connections
 librdmacm is a library that allows applications to set up reliable
 connected and unreliable datagram transfers when using RDMA adapters.
 It provides a transport-neutral interface in the sense that the same
 code can be used for both InfiniBand and iWARP adapters.  The
 interface is based on sockets, but adapted for queue pair (QP) based
 semantics: communication must use a specific RDMA device, and data
 transfers are message-based.
 .
 librdmacm only provides communication management (connection setup
 and tear-down) and works in conjunction with the verbs interface
 provided by libibverbs, which provides the interface used to actually
 transfer data.

Description: RE2 regex engine
 re::engine::RE2 replaces perl's regex engine
 in a given lexical scope with RE2.
 .
 RE2 is a primarily DFA based regexp engine from Google
 that is very fast at matching large amounts of text.
 However it does not support look behind
 and some other Perl regular expression features.
 See RE2's syntax wiki page
 at <https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax> for more information.
 .
 Fallback to normal Perl regexp is implemented by this module.
 If RE2 is unable to compile a regexp it will use Perl instead,
 therefore features not implemented by RE2 don't suddenly stop working,
 they will just use Perl's regexp implementation.

Version: 20230301-3build1
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.38), libgcc-s1 (>= 3.3.1), libstdc++6 (>= 11)
Description: efficient, principled regular expression library
 RE2 is a fast, safe, thread-friendly alternative to backtracking regular
 expression engines like those used in PCRE, Perl, and Python. It is a C++
 library.
 .
 RE2 uses automata theory to guarantee that regular expression searches run in
 time linear in the size of the input. RE2 implements memory limits, so that
 searches can be constrained to a fixed amount of memory. RE2 is engineered to
 use a small fixed C++ stack footprint no matter what inputs or regular
 expressions it must process; thus RE2 is useful in multithreaded environments
 where thread stacks cannot grow arbitrarily large.
 .
 On large inputs, RE2 is often much faster than backtracking engines; its use
 of automata theory lets it apply optimizations that the others cannot.

 libref-util-perl): If the system doesn't have Recommends turned off, you will
 get libref-util-xs-perl automatically. Ref::Util::XS will be used
 automatically, providing a significant speed boost to everything that uses
 Ref::Util.
 .

Description: "Solver for Nonlinear Programming" extension for LibreOffice
 By default LibreOffice Calc ships with a solver engine for linear
 programming only. This allows the optimization of models to a certain degree.
 However, if the formulas or constraints become more complex,
 nonlinear programming is required. That missing gap is now filled by the
 Solver for Nonlinear Programming extension.
 .
 Currently it incorporates two Evolutionary Algorithms which are able to
 handle floating point and integer variables as well as nonlinear constraints.

Description: Perl module for minimalist role composition
 Role::Tiny is a Perl module to do minimalist role composition. Role composition
 can be thought of as much more clever and meaningful multiple inheritance.
 .
 The basics of this implementation of roles is:
  * If a method is already defined on a class, that method will not be composed
    in from the role.
  * If a method that the role "requires" to be implemented is not implemented,
    role application will fail loudly.
 .
 Unlike Class::C3, where the last class inherited from "wins", role composition
 is the other way around, where first wins. In a more complete system (see
 Moose) roles are checked to see if they clash. The goal of this is to be much
 simpler, hence disallowing composition of multiple roles at once.

Version: 0.2.2-4build1
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14)
Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

Description: API library for scanners -- documentation and support files
 SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
 programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
 raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
 video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
 free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
 current source code is written to support several operating systems,
 including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
 under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
 backends are welcome, too, however).
 .
 This package includes documentation for libsane, such as the man pages
 and list of supported scanners, and support files (i18n data).

Description: API library for scanners
 SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
 programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
 raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
 video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
 free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
 current source code is written to support several operating systems,
 including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
 under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
 backends are welcome, too, however).
 .
 Graphical frontends for sane are available in the packages sane and
 xsane. Command line frontend scanimage, saned and sane-find-scanner are
 available in the sane-utils package.

Description: Cyrus SASL - authentication abstraction library
 This is the Cyrus SASL API implementation, version 2.1.
 .
 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.
 .
 Any of: ANONYMOUS, SCRAM, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT or Heimdal
 Kerberos 5), NTLM, OTP, PLAIN, or LOGIN can be used.

Description: lightweight RDF syntax library
 Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading
 and writing Turtle and NTriples.
 .
 Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather
 is suited to resource limited applications, or situations where a simple
 reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2 hosts or
 plugins).
 .
 Serd is:
  * small: Serd is implemented in under 2500 lines1 of standard C code.
  * portable and dependency-free: Serd uses only the C standard library,
    and has no external dependencies, making it a lightweight dependency
    in every sense.
  * fast and lightweight: Serd (and the included serdi tool) can be used
    to stream abbreviated Turtle (unlike many other tools which can not
    stream since they must first build an internal model to abbreviate).
    In other words, Serd can re-serialise an unbounded amount of Turtle
    using a fixed amount of memory, preserving the abbreviations in the
    input.
  * conformant and well-tested: Serd is written to the Turtle, NTriples
    and URI specifications, and includes a comprehensive test suite which
    includes all the normative examples from the Turtle specification, all
    the "normal" examples from the URI specification, and additional tests
    added specifically for Serd. The test suite has over 96% code coverage
    (by line), and runs with zero memory errors or leaks.

 Most OSes have SCSI pass-through interfaces that enable user space programs
 to send SCSI commands to a device and fetch the response. With SCSI to ATA
 Translation (SAT) many ATA disks now can process SCSI commands. Typically
 each utility in this package implements one SCSI command. See the draft
 standards at www.t10.org for SCSI command definitions plus SAT. ATA
 commands are defined in the draft standards at www.t13.org . For a mapping
 between supported SCSI and ATA commands and utility names in this package
 see the COVERAGE file

 library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable
 compression.
 .
 For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy
 is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting
 compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core
 of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250
 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.

 The Sort::Versions module allows easy sorting (via comparisons) of mixed text

 revision control packages and shared library systems use. For an explanation
 of the algorithm, it's easiest to look at these examples:
 .
  1.1   <  1.2
  1.1a  <  1.2
  1.1   <  1.1.1
  1.1   <  1.1a
  1.1.a <  1.1a
  1     <  a
  a     <  b
  1     <  2
 .
  (special handling for leading zeros)
  0002  <  1
  1.06  <  1.5
 .
  (a hyphen binds looser than a period)
  1-1 < 1-2
  1-2 < 1.2

Description: library for ambisonic encoding and decoding (runtime files)
 libspatialaudio is an open-source and cross-platform C++ library for Ambisonic
 encoding and decoding, filtering and binaural rendering. It is targeted to
 render High-Order Ambisonic (HOA) and VR/3D audio samples in multiple
 environments, from headphones to classic loudspeakers. Its binaural rendering
 can be used for classical 5.1/7.1 spatial channels as well as Ambisonics
 inputs.  It supports Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA) and ACN/SN3D Ambisonics
 audio streams following the Google spatial audio specification and the IETF
 codec Ambisonics specification.
 .
 The library allows you to encode, decode, rotate, zoom HOA Ambisonics audio
 streams up to the 3rd order. It can output to standard and custom loudspeakers
 arrays. To playback with headphones, the binauralizer applies an HRTF (either
 a SOFA file or the included MIT HRTF) to provide a spatial binaural rendering
 effect. The binauralization can also be used to render multichannels streams
 (5.1, 7.1...).

Description: module to create Excel spreadsheets
 Spreadsheet::WriteExcel is a Perl module that can be used to create a cross-
 platform Excel binary file. Multiple worksheets can be added to a workbook
 and formatting can be applied to cells. Additionally, this module supports
 writing text, numeric values, formulas and hyperlinks to cells.
 .
 The Excel file produced by this module is compatible with Excel 5, 95, 97
 and 2000. Generated files are also compatible with the Linux/UNIX spreadsheet
 applications OpenOffice.org, Gnumeric and XESS. The generated files are not
 compatible with MS Access.
 .
 This module cannot be used to read an Excel file. See Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
 (libspreadsheet-parseexcel-perl) or look at the main documentation for some
 suggestions. This module cannot be used to write to an existing Excel file.

Description: library for serialising LV2 atoms to/from Turtle
 Sratom is a new C library for serialising LV2 atoms to/from Turtle.
 It is intended to be a full serialisation solution for LV2 atoms,
 allowing implementations to serialise binary atoms to strings and
 read them back again. This is particularly useful for saving plugin
 state, or implementing plugin control with network transparency.
 Sratom uses Serd and Sord to do the work, it is a small library
 implemented in a single source file, suitable for direct inclusion
 in projects if avoiding a dependency is desired.

Description: Snowball stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval
 Snowball provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a
 "stemmed" form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common
 morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common
 linguistic base form.  This is most useful in building search engines
 and information retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming
 enabled should be able to find a document containing "cycling" given the
 query "cycles".
 .
 Snowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.
 It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for
 English: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm, the
 original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval
 researchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.

 Sub::Exporter features like currying, this module will only use
 Sub::Exporter, so you might as well use it directly.

 stash_name returns its package, and sub_fullname returns the
 concatenation of the two.

 The fourth function, get_code_info, returns a list of two elements,
 the package and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried
 by the speed.)
 .
 In case of subroutine aliasing, those functions always return the

Description: module for assigning a new name to referenced sub
 Sub::Name has only one function, which is also exported by default:
 .
 subname NAME, CODEREF
 .
 Assigns a new name to referenced sub. If package specification is
 omitted in the name, then the current package is used. The return
 value is the sub.
 .
 The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc).
 You won't be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name. To
 allow that, you need to do glob-assignment yourself.

Description: Direct solution of large, sparse systems of linear equations
 SuperLU is a general purpose library for the direct solution of
 large, sparse, nonsymmetric systems of linear equations on high
 performance machines.
 .
 The library is written in C and is callable from either C or Fortran.
 The library routines will perform an LU decomposition with partial
 pivoting and triangular system solves through forward and back
 substitution. The LU factorization routines can handle non-square
 matrices but the triangular solves are performed only for square
 matrices. The matrix columns may be preordered (before factorization)
 either through library or user supplied routines. This preordering
 for sparsity is completely separate from the factorization. Working
 precision iterative refinement subroutines are provided for improved
 backward stability. Routines are also provided to equilibrate the
 system, estimate the condition number, calculate the relative
 backward error, and estimate error bounds for the refined solutions.
 .
 This package contains the SuperLU shared library.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").
 .
 This package contains the development files.

 Libteam provides a mechanism to team multiple NICs (ports) at OSI Layer 2
 (Data link) into a single virtual NIC. The process is called "channel
 bonding", "Ethernet bonding", "channel teaming", "link aggregation", etc.
 This is already implemented in the Linux kernel by the bonding driver but
 unlike the bonding driver, libteam (user space) has the following
 additional features:
  * load-balancing for LACP support
  * NS/NA (IPV6) link monitoring
  * port priorities and stickiness ("primary" option enhancement)
  * separate per-port link monitoring setup
 .
 Libteam requires Linux kernel 3.3 or higher.

 two strings. This distance is the number of substitutions, deletions or
 insertions ("edits") needed to transform one string into the other one (and
 vice versa). When two strings have distance 0, they are the same.

Description: scalable template engine for Perl 5 (C/XS accelerated)
 Text::Xslate is a template engine, tuned for persistent applications, safe
 as an HTML generator, and with rich features.
 .
 There are a lot of template engines in CPAN, for example Template-Toolkit,
 Text::MicroTemplate, HTML::Template, and so on, but all of them have some
 weak points: a full-featured template engine may be slow, while a fast
 template engine may be too simple to use. This is why Text::Xslate is
 developed, which is to be the best template engine for web applications.
 .
 The concept of Text::Xslate is strongly influenced by Text::MicroTemplate and
 Template-Toolkit 2, but the central philosophy of Text::Xslate is different
 from them. That is, the philosophy is one of sandboxing; that the template
 logic should not have no access outside the template beyond your permission.

 For historical reasons this module coexists with Unicode::Map8.
 Please use Unicode::Map8 unless you need to care for >1 byte

 basic functionality (see documentation) you can use both modules
 equivalently.

 waiting for availability in a set of sockets, and some other events like timers
 or asynchronous messages. However, libuv also comes with some other extras
 like:
  * files watchers and asynchronous operations
  * a portable TCP and UDP API, as well as asynchronous DNS resolution
  * processes and threads management, and a portable inter-process
    communications mechanism, with pipes and work queues
  * a plugins mechanism for loading libraries dynamically
  * interface with external libraries that also need to access the I/O.
 .

Description: Collection of video4linux support libraries
 libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 .
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 .
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

 Audio visualization is the process of making pretty moving images that
 are correlated in some way to the audio currently being played by a media
 player. Most audio visualization is tied to a specific application or media
 player, making it difficult to share code. Libvisual allows applications
 to use existing visualization plugins written for the libvisual framework.
 .
 This package provides the runtime libraries for libvisual. Libvisual is not
 very useful without visualization plugins, so it is highly recommended to
 install the libvisual-0.4-plugins package.

Description: wxBase library (runtime) - non-GUI support classes of wxWidgets toolkit
 wxBase is a collection of C++ classes providing basic data structures
 (strings, lists, arrays), powerful wxDateTime class for date manipulations,
 portable wrappers around many OS-specific functions allowing the same
 program to work for all supported platforms, wxThread class for writing
 multithreaded programs, and much more.
 .
 wxBase currently supports the following platforms: Generic Unix (Linux,
 FreeBSD, Solaris, HP-UX, ...), Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS X.
 .
 This package is only useful for non-GUI apps.  It offers a subset of the
 classes in libwx_gtk3.2 for use in console apps and daemons.  You do not need
 this package to build or use wxWidgets GUI apps.

Description: X cursor management library
 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
 .
 Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via
 xcursor-themes or other cursor-theme or icon-theme packages,
 configured with update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.

 Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of
 C++.  Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give your application the ability
 to read and write XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing,
 generating, manipulating, and validating XML documents. Xerces-C++ is
 faithful to the XML 1.0 recommendation and associated standards (DOM
 1.0, DOM 2.0, SAX 1.0, SAX 2.0, Namespaces, XML Schema Part 1 and
 Part 2).  It also provides experimental implementations of XML 1.1
 and DOM Level 3.0.  The parser provides high performance, modularity,
 and scalability.

Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

 XML::SAX::Base is a base class for PerlSAX drivers and filters.  The main
 advantages that it provides are easy dispatching of events the right way (ie
 it takes care for you of checking that the handler has implemented that
 method, or has defined an AUTOLOAD), and the guarantee that filters will pass
 along events that they aren't implementing to handlers downstream that might
 nevertheless be interested in them.

Description: Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors
 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and
 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed
 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an
 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you
 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs
 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the
 javaness.
 .
 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it
 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a
 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in
 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.
 .
 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called
 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This
 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to
 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.

Description: Perl module for reading and writing XML
 The XML::Simple module provides a simple API layer on top of an underlying
 XML parsing module to maintain XML files (especially configuration
 files).  Two functions are exported: XMLin() and XMLout().
 .
 The simplest approach is to call these two functions directly, but an
 optional object oriented interface allows them to be called as
 methods of an XML::Simple object.  The object interface can also be
 used at either end of a SAX pipeline.
 .
 Note from upstream: The use of this module in new code is strongly
 discouraged. Other modules are available which provide more straightforward
 and consistent interfaces. In particular, XML::LibXML is highly recommended.
 XML::Twig is another excellent alternative.These modules are packaged as
 libxml-libxml-perl and libxml-twig-perl in Debian.

Description: Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode
 The XML::Twig module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser.
 .
 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to
 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.
 .
 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the
 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,
 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots
 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase
 performance.
 .
 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to
 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes
 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

Description: re-usable XPath engine for DOM-like trees
 XML::XPathEngine provides an XPath engine, that can be re-used by other
 module/classes that implement trees.
 .
 In order to use the XPath engine, nodes in the user module need to mimic
 DOM nodes. The degree of similarity between the user tree and a DOM dictates
 how much of the XPath features can be used. A module implementing all of the
 DOM should be able to use this module very easily (you might need to add
 the cmp method on nodes in order to get ordered result sets).
 .
 This module is derived from Matt Sergeant's XML::XPath.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - common files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.

Description: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 The strengths of the LLVM infrastructure are its extremely
 simple design (which makes it easy to understand and use),
 source-language independence, powerful mid-level optimizer, automated
 compiler debugging support, extensibility, and its stability and
 reliability. LLVM is currently being used to host a wide variety of
 academic research projects and commercial projects. LLVM includes C
 and C++ front-ends, a front-end for a Forth-like language (Stacker),
 a young scheme front-end, and Java support is in development. LLVM can
 generate code for X96, SparcV10, PowerPC or many other architectures.

Description: Log rotation utility
 The logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of
 log files on a system which generates a lot of log files.  Logrotate
 allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of
 log files.  Logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly,
 monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.  Normally, logrotate
 runs as a daily cron job.

Description: Pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

 Memtest86+ provides a more thorough memory check than

 directly by a PC BIOS (legacy or UEFI) or via an intermediate
 bootloader.
 .
 This tester runs independently of any OS - it is run at computer
 boot-up, so that it can test *all* of your memory.  You may want to
 look at `memtester', which allows one to test your memory within Linux,
 but this one won't be able to test your whole RAM.
 .
 It can output a list of bad RAM regions usable by the BadRAM kernel
 patch, so that you can still use your old RAM with one or two bad bits.

  - chronic: runs a command quietly unless it fails
  - combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
  - errno: look up errno names and descriptions
  - ifdata: get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
  - ifne: run a program if the standard input is not empty
  - isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
  - lckdo: execute a program with a lock held
  - mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
  - parallel: run multiple jobs at once
  - pee: tee standard input to pipes
  - sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
  - ts: timestamp standard input
  - vidir: edit a directory in your text editor

 mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs
 in a single network diagnostic tool.
 .
 As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host
 mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.  After it
 determines the address of each network hop between the machines,
 it sends a sequence of ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the
 quality of the link to each machine.  As it does this, it prints
 running statistics about each machine.
 .
 mtr-tiny is compiled without support for X and conserves disk space.

 The NFS kernel server is currently the recommended NFS server for use
 with Linux, featuring features such as NFSv3 and NFSv4, Kerberos
 support via GSS, and much more. It is also significantly faster and
 usually more reliable than the user-space NFS servers (from the
 unfs3 and nfs-user-server packages). However, it is more difficult to
 debug than the user-space servers, and has a slightly different
 feature set.
 .
 This package contains the user-space support needed to use the
 NFS kernel server. Most administrators wishing to set up an NFS server
 would want to install this package.

 This software provides an in-kernel packet classification framework that is
 based on a network-specific Virtual Machine (VM) and the nft userspace
 command line tool. The nftables framework reuses the existing Netfilter
 subsystems such as the existing hook infrastructure, the connection tracking
 system, NAT, userspace queueing and logging subsystem.
 .
 nftables replaces the old popular iptables, ip6tables, arptables and ebtables.
 .
 Netfilter software and nftables in particular are used in applications such
 as Internet connection sharing, firewalls, IP accounting, transparent
 proxying, advanced routing and traffic control.
 .
 A Linux kernel >= 3.13 is required. However, >= 4.14 is recommended.

Description: Network Time Protocol daemon and utility programs
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains the NTP daemon and utility programs.  An NTP
 daemon needs to be running on each host that is to have its clock
 accuracy controlled by NTP.  The same NTP daemon is also used to
 provide NTP service to other hosts.
 .
 This is the NTPsec version of NTP.  NTPsec is a secure, hardened,
 and improved implementation derived from the original NTP project.
 NTPsec supports Network Time Security (NTS) which provides
 cryptographically authenticated time.
 .
 For more information about the NTP protocol and NTP server
 configuration and operation, install the package "ntpsec-doc".

Description: iSCSI initiator tools
 The Open-iSCSI project is a high-performance, transport independent,
 multi-platform implementation of RFC3720 iSCSI.
 .
 Open-iSCSI is partitioned into user and kernel parts.
 .
 The kernel portion of Open-iSCSI is a from-scratch code
 licensed under GPL. The kernel part implements iSCSI data path
 (that is, iSCSI Read and iSCSI Write), and consists of three
 loadable modules: scsi_transport_iscsi.ko, libiscsi.ko and iscsi_tcp.ko.
 .
 User space contains the entire control plane: configuration
 manager, iSCSI Discovery, Login and Logout processing,
 connection-level error processing, Nop-In and Nop-Out handling,
 and (in the future:) Text processing, iSNS, SLP, Radius, etc.
 .
 The user space Open-iSCSI consists of a daemon process called
 iscsid, and a management utility iscsiadm.
 .
 This package includes a daemon, iscsid, and a management utility,
 iscsiadm.

 The OpenJade processor, in conjunction with a DSSSL style sheet, is
 capable of translating SGML documents into other formats.  Output
 formats currently supported are RTF, HTML, MIF, JadeTeX, or an XML
 representation of the flow object tree.  Using its own non-standard
 system, it is also capable of transforming one SGML or XML DTD to
 another.

 This package includes a collection of free PostScript Printer Description
 files for PostScript (and clone) printers from various manufacturers, as
 distributed by OpenPrinting.
 .
 If you have non-PostScript printers, the foomatic-db-compressed-ppds (or
 foomatic-db and foomatic-db-engine), hplip and the
 printer-driver-* packages are the ones you need; this package
 won't be of much help to you.
 .
 Some manufacturers distribute PPD files for their printers under
 non-free licenses; those are not included in this package, but may be
 available from the manufacturer's website, included on a CD or
 other media with the printer, or downloadable from the OpenPrinting
 web site (even automatically if the printer setup tool supports it).

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

 OpenVPN is an application to securely tunnel IP networks over a
 single UDP or TCP port. It can be used to access remote sites, make
 secure point-to-point connections, enhance wireless security, etc.
 .
 OpenVPN uses all of the encryption, authentication, and certification
 features provided by the OpenSSL library (any cipher, key size, or
 HMAC digest).
 .
 OpenVPN may use static, pre-shared keys or TLS-based dynamic key exchange. It
 also supports VPNs with dynamic endpoints (DHCP or dial-up clients), tunnels
 over NAT or connection-oriented stateful firewalls (such as Linux's iptables).

 A flexible, extensible, and powerful assistive technology that
 provides end-user access to applications and toolkits that support the

 Orca defines a set of default behaviors (reactions to application events) and
 key bindings (reaction to user key presses). These default behaviors and key
 bindings can be overwritten on a per-application basis. Orca creates a script
 object for each running application, which merges both the default behaviors
 and key bindings, and the application specific ones. Orca provides the
 infrastructure to activate and deactivate scripts, as well as a host of
 services accessible from within the scripts.

 Its main benefits are:
  - Unified developer and user interface on many distributions
  - Fine-grained permission control via PolicyKit
  - On-demand installation of missing system components

Description: disk partition manipulator
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,
 move, and copy disk partitions. This is useful for creating space
 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

 classic mixer tools this one allows you to control both the volume of
 hardware devices and of each playback stream separately. It also allows
 you to redirect a playback stream to another output device without
 interrupting playback.

Description: Portable Archive Interchange (cpio, pax, tar)
 paxtar is an implementation of an archiving utility that reads
 and writes several formats - traditional ones, the extended
 formats specified in IEEE 1003.1, and the ar(5) format used
 by deb(5) packages (MirBSD specific paxtar extension). The
 pax interface was designed by IEEE 1003.2 as a compromise in
 the chronic controversy over which of tar or cpio is best, but
 this implementation offers paxcpio and paxtar for easy calling.
 .
 This is the MirBSD paxtar implementation supporting the formats
 ar, bcpio, cpio, SVR4 cpio with and without CRC, old tar, and
 ustar, but not the format known as pax yet. It has extensions
 for removing non-numerical user and group IDs from the archive,
 storing hardlinked files only once, setting ownership to the
 superuser, anonymising inode and device information, changing
 the mtime to zero, and producing GNU tar compatible trailing
 slashes on ustar directory nodes. Its "ar" format is suitable
 for operating on *.deb files, unlike that of GNU binutils.
 .
 Note that ACLs and Extended Attributes are not supported.

Description: personal package builder for Debian packages
 pbuilder constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the
 chroot.
 It is an ideal system to use to check
 that a package has correct build-dependencies.
 It uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast connection
 to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not necessary.
 .
 "pbuilder create" uses debootstrap to create a chroot image.
 .
 "pbuilder update" updates the image to the current state of
 testing/unstable/whatever
 .
 "pbuilder build" takes a *.dsc file and builds a binary in the chroot
 image.
 .
 pdebuild is a wrapper for Debian Developers, to allow running
 pbuilder just like "debuild", as a normal user.

Description: PCMCIA utilities for Linux 2.6
 This package provides PCMCIA initialisation tools for Linux 2.6.13-rc1 or
 later, replacing the old pcmcia-cs tools used with earlier kernel versions.
 PCMCIA cards are commonly used in laptops to provide expanded capabilities
 such as network connections, modems, increased memory, etc.
 .
 To use PCMCIA you need to have kernel modules available to support
 it. These are included in the stock Debian 2.6 kernel packages. You
 will most likely also need udev, although it isn't always required.
 .
 The wireless-tools package is required by many wireless network adapters.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Description: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules-5.38' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules-5.38') instead.

Description: version compatibility baseline for Perl OpenSSL packages
 A subset of Perl XS module packages expose the OpenSSL binary interface
 to Perl code. This can lead to incompatibilities if these packages are
 linked against different versions of OpenSSL.
 .
 This package provides a virtual package "perl-openssl-abi-x" that
 corresponds to the libssl-dev package SONAME it was built against.
 The packages that need to stay compatible with each other can depend
 on this.
 .
 Tools are also provided for generating this dependency with minimum
 hassle. See the instructions in README.Debian.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or

 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Description: run commands as another user with polkit authorization
 polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 It was previously named PolicyKit.
 .
 pkexec is a setuid program to allow certain users to run commands as
 root or as a different user, similar to sudo. Unlike sudo, it carries
 out authentication and authorization by sending a request to polkit,
 so it uses desktop environments' familiar prompting mechanisms for
 authentication and uses polkit policies for authorization decisions.
 .
 By default, members of the 'sudo' Unix group can use pkexec to run any
 command after authenticating. The authorization rules can be changed by
 the local system administrator.
 .
 If this functionality is not required, removing the pkexec package will
 reduce security risk by removing a setuid program.

Description: boot animation, logger and I/O multiplexer
 Plymouth provides a boot-time I/O multiplexing framework - the most obvious
 use for which is to provide an attractive graphical animation in place of
 the text messages that normally get shown during boot. (The messages are
 instead redirected to a logfile for later viewing.) However, in event-driven
 boot systems Plymouth can also usefully handle user interaction such as
 password prompts for encrypted file systems.
 .
 This package provides the basic framework, enabling a text-mode animation.

Description: authentication agent for PolicyKit
 PolicyKit-gnome provides a D-Bus session bus service that is used to

 and MATE, have their own built-in PolicyKit agents and no longer use
 this one. The remaining users of this implementation are Cinnamon, XFCE

Description: run common desktop actions without password
 This package provides a set of PolicyKit privileges which allow Administrators
 to run common actions without being asked for their password:
 .
  * mounting and checking internal disk drives (through udisks)
  * setting the CPU speed and policy (through the GNOME CPU frequency applet)
  * setting the time and timezone (through the GNOME clock applet or through
    KDE)
  * Update already installed software
  * Configure printers
 .
 It does not change privileges for non-Administrators (users who are not in the
 "sudo" group). So this satisfies the typical desktop/laptop use
 case where the user has full control over the hardware anyway.
 .
 This is implemented by shipping a polkitd set of rules.

Description: framework for managing administrative policies and privileges
 polkit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the policy
 that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged processes.
 It was previously named PolicyKit.
 .
 It is a framework for centralizing the decision making process with respect to
 granting access to privileged operations for unprivileged (desktop)
 applications.
 .
 In a typical use of polkit, an unprivileged application such as gnome-disks
 sends requests via D-Bus or other inter-process communication mechanisms
 to a privileged system service such as udisks, which asks polkitd for
 permission to process those requests. This allows the application to carry
 out privileged tasks without making use of setuid, which avoids several
 common sources of security vulnerabilities.
 .
 This package provides the polkitd D-Bus service and supporting programs.
 The pkexec program is not included, and can be found in the pkexec package.

 be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time being
 sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the outside
 has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.

 power-profiles-daemon offers to modify system behaviour based upon
 user-selected power profiles. There are 3 different power profiles, a
 "balanced" default mode, a "power-saver" mode, as well as a "performance"
 mode. The first 2 of those are available on every system. The "performance"
 mode is only available on select systems and is implemented by different
 "drivers" based on the system or systems it targets.
 .
 In addition to those 2 or 3 modes (depending on the system),
 "actions" can be hooked up to change the behaviour of a particular device.
 For example, this can be used to disable the fast-charging for some USB
 devices when in power-saver mode.

Description: extraction of elements from LaTeX documents as graphics
 The purpose of preview is the extraction of selected elements from a
 LaTeX source, like formulas or graphics, into separate pages of a DVI
 file.  A flexible and convenient interface allows it to specify what
 commands and constructs should be extracted.  This works with DVI files
 postprocessed by either Dvips and Ghostscript or dvipng, but it also
 works when using PDFTeX for generating PDF files.
 .
 Currently, preview.sty is used by preview-latex, the WYSIWYG component of
 the AUCTeX editing environment; for generation of previews in LyX; as
 part of the operation of the ps4pdf and pst-pdf LaTeX packages; by the
 tbook XML system and some other tools.

Description: convert PostScript to EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files
 ps2eps is a tool to produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF)
 from usual one-paged Postscript documents. It calculates correct
 Bounding Boxes for those EPS files and filters some special
 postscript command sequences that can produce erroneous results on
 printers.  EPS files are needed for including (scalable) graphics
 into TeX (or even Word) documents.  Other programs like ps2epsi do
 not calculate the bounding box always correctly (because the values are
 put on the PostScript stack which may get corrupted by bad PostScript
 code) or rounded it off so that clipping the EPS cut off some parts of
 the image. Therefore ps2eps uses a resolution of 144 DPI to get the
 correct bounding box.

 Starting with the Debian 11 (bullseye) and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal)

 interpreter and do not use unversioned /usr/bin/python at all. Some
 third-party code is now predominantly python3 based, yet may use
 /usr/bin/python.

 This is a convenience package which ships a symlink to point
 the /usr/bin/python interpreter at the current default python3. It may
 improve compatibility with other modern systems, whilst breaking some
 obsolete or 3rd-party software.

 completions for your argument/option values (for example, if the user
 is browsing resources over the network).
 .

Description: Python interface to the GPGME GnuPG encryption library (Python 3)
 The "gpg" Python module is, for the most part, a direct interface to
 the C GPGME library.  However, it is re-packaged in a more Pythonic
 way -- object-oriented with classes and modules.  Take a look at the
 classes defined here -- they correspond directly to certain object
 types in GPGME for C.
 .
 Features:
  * Feature-rich, full implementation of the GPGME library. Supports
    all GPGME features except interactive editing (coming soon).
    Callback functions may be written in pure Python.
  * Ability to sign, encrypt, decrypt, and verify data.
  * Ability to list keys, export and import keys, and manage the keyring.
  * Fully object-oriented with convenient classes and modules.
 .
 This is the official upstream Python 3 binding for GPGME.

Description: Hamcrest framework for matcher objects (Python 3)
 PyHamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, allowing you to
 declaratively define "match" rules. There are a number of situations where
 matchers are invaluable, such as UI validation, or data filtering, but it is in
 the area of writing flexible tests that matchers are most commonly used. This
 tutorial shows you how to use PyHamcrest for unit testing.
 .
 When writing tests it is sometimes difficult to get the balance right between
 overspecifying the test (and making it brittle to changes), and not specifying
 enough (making the test less valuable since it continues to pass even when the
 thing being tested is broken). Having a tool that allows you to pick out
 precisely the aspect under test and describe the values it should have, to a
 controlled level of precision, helps greatly in writing tests that are
 "just right." Such tests fail when the behavior of the aspect under test
 deviates from the expected behavior, yet continue to pass when minor,
 unrelated changes to the behaviour are made.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x modules.

Description: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django

 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it’s
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It’s possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

 From the IETF site:
 .
 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC4627] is a common format for the
 exchange and storage of structured data.  HTTP PATCH [RFC5789] extends the
 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] with a method to perform partial
 modifications to resources.
 .
 JSON Patch is a format (identified by the media type "application/
 json-patch") for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a target JSON
 document, suitable for use with the HTTP PATCH method.
 .
 This format is also potentially useful in other cases when it's necessary to
 make partial updates to a JSON document.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.

   * Use Python unicode strings in API.
   * Safe (no segfaults).
   * No manual memory management!

 lxml aims to provide a Pythonic API by following as much as possible
 the ElementTree API, trying to avoid inventing too many new APIs,
 or the user's having to learn new things -- XML is complicated enough.

 Mako is a template library written in Python. It provides a familiar, non-XML
 syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance. Mako's
 syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others, including Django
 templates, Cheetah, Myghty, and Genshi. Conceptually, Mako is an embedded
 Python (i.e. Python Server Page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of
 componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most
 straightforward and flexible models available, while also maintaining close
 ties to Python calling and scoping semantics.

 TLS), SSH2 protocol does not require hierarchical certificates signed by a
 powerful central authority. You may know SSH2 as the protocol that replaced
 Telnet and rsh for secure access to remote shells, but the protocol also
 includes the ability to open arbitrary channels to remote services across the
 encrypted tunnel (this is how SFTP works, for example).

    for larger grammars.
  * PLY  provides most  of  the standard  lex/yacc features  including
    support for  empty productions, precedence  rules, error recovery,

 code, tracebacks, and more — out of the box.
 .
 Here's a list of the core functionalities of rich:
 .
  * to effortlessly add rich output to your application, you can import the rich
    print method, which has the same signature as the builtin Python function
  * Rich can be installed in the Python REPL, so that any data structures will
    be pretty printed and highlighted
  * for more control over rich terminal content, import and construct a Console
    object. The Console object has a print method which has an intentionally
    similar interface to the builtin print function
  * to insert an emoji in to console output place the name between two colons
  * Rich can render flexible tables with unicode box characters. There is a
    large variety of formatting options for borders, styles, cell alignment etc
  * Rich can render multiple flicker-free progress bars to track long-running
    tasks.
  * Rich can render content in neat columns with equal or optimal width.
  * Rich can render markdown and does a reasonable job of translating the
    formatting to the terminal
  * Rich can render beautiful tracebacks which are easier to read and show more
    code than standard Python tracebacks. You can set Rich as the default
    traceback handler so all uncaught exceptions will be rendered by Rich.

Version: 2.2.0-4build1
Depends: python3:any
Suggests: python3-stemmer
Description: Pure Python Snowball stemming library
 Snowball provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a
 "stemmed" form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common
 morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common
 linguistic base form.  This is most useful in building search engines
 and information retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming
 enabled should be able to find a document containing "cycling" given the
 query "cycles".
 .
 Snowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.
 It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for
 English: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm, the
 original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval
 researchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.
 .
 This package contains the pure Python module that implements Snowball
 algorithms. When python3-stemmer package (which contains the C extension)
 is installed, it uses that extension instead of the pure Python code.

 offer all features of this library, to name just a few more prominent ones:
 .
  * is slower (by not having the app-data seed method),
  * is not as extendable,
  * cannot create virtual environments for arbitrarily installed Python
    versions (and automatically discover these),
  * does not have as rich programmatic API (describe virtual environments
    without creating them).
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the library.  It includes the command line
 script.

Description: Python implementation of the WHATWG Encoding standard
 In order to be compatible with legacy web content when interpreting something
 like Content-Type: text/html; charset=latin1, tools need to use a particular
 set of aliases for encoding labels as well as some overriding rules.  For
 example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are actually aliases for
 windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes precedence over any other
 encoding declaration.  The Encoding standard defines all such details so that
 implementations do not have to reverse-engineer each other.
 .
 This module has encoding labels and BOM detection, but the actual
 implementation for encoders and decoders is Python’s.
 .
 This package provides the module for Python 3.

Version: 1.15.0-2build3
Depends: python3 (<< 3.13), python3 (>= 3.12~), python3:any, libc6 (>= 2.4)
Description: decorators, wrappers and monkey patching. - Python 3.x
 The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy for
 Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function
 wrappers and decorator functions.
 .
 The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way
 beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators
 preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The
 decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more
 scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent
 behaviour.
 .
 To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module is
 used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a pure
 Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not have a
 compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.

 xcffib is intended to be a (mostly) drop-in replacement for xpyb. xpyb has an

Description: Tool to work with series of patches
 Quilt manages a series of patches by keeping track of the changes
 each of them makes. They are logically organized as a stack, and you can
 apply, un-apply, refresh them easily by traveling into the stack (push/pop).
 .
 Quilt is good for managing additional patches applied to a package received
 as a tarball or maintained in another version control system. The stacked
 organization is proven to be efficient for the management of very large patch
 sets (more than hundred patches). As matter of fact, it was designed by and
 for Linux kernel hackers (Andrew Morton, from the -mm  branch, is the
 original author), and its main use by the current upstream maintainer is to
 manage the (hundreds of) patches against the kernel made for the SUSE
 distribution.
 .
 This package provides seamless integration into Debhelper or CDBS,
 allowing maintainers to easily add a quilt-based patch management system in
 their packages. The package also provides some basic support for those not
 using those tools. See README.Debian for more information.

Description: ruby make-like utility
 Rake is a simple ruby build program with capabilities similar to make.
 .
 Rake has the following features:
   * Rakefiles (rakes version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
     standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile
     syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
   * Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
   * Rake supports rule patterns to sythesize implicit tasks.
   * Rake is lightweight. It can be distributed with other
     projects as a single file. Projects that depend upon
     rake do not require that rake be installed on target
     systems.

Description: reports bugs in the Debian distribution
 reportbug is a tool designed to make the reporting of bugs in Debian
 and derived distributions relatively painless.  Its features include:
 .
  * Integration with many mail user agents.
  * Access to outstanding bug reports to make it easier to identify
    whether problems have already been reported.
  * Automatic checking for newer versions of packages.
  * Optional automatic verification of integrity of packages via debsums.
  * Support for following-up on outstanding reports.
  * Optional PGP/GnuPG integration.
 .
 Bug reporting in Debian relies on email; reportbug can use a local
 mail transport agent (like exim or sendmail), submit directly through
 an external mail server, or pass messages to an installed mail user
 agent (e.g., mutt) for submission.
 .
 This package also includes the "querybts" script for browsing the
 Debian bug tracking system.
 .
 REPORTBUG IS MEANT FOR UBUNTU DEVELOPERS TO FORWARD BUGS TO DEBIAN.
 IF YOU WANT TO REPORT A BUG IN UBUNTU, PLEASE USE "ubuntu-bug"
 INSTEAD (from the "apport" package).

Description: Recursively searches directories for a regex pattern
 ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches your current
 directory for a regex pattern while respecting your gitignore rules and
 automatically skip hidden files/directories (smart filtering) and binary files.
 ripgrep is similar to other popular search tools like The Silver Searcher, ack
 and grep.
 .
 ripgrep is generally faster than both The Silver Searcher and GNU grep. It
 defaults to recursive directory search and won't search files ignored by your
 `.gitignore` files. Use ripgrep if you like speed, filtering by default, fewer
 bugs, and Unicode support.
 .
 On the other hand, if you like multiline search, then ripgrep may not quite
 meet your needs (yet), and it will never support fancy regex features such as
 backreferences or lookaround

 and to/from a remote host. It offers many options to control its behavior,
 and its remote-update protocol can minimize network traffic to make
 transferring updates between machines fast and efficient.

Description: GNOME UPnP/DLNA services
 Rygel is a home media solution that allows you to easily share audio, video
 and pictures, and control of media player on your home network. In technical
 terms it is both a UPnP AV MediaServer and MediaRenderer implemented through
 a plug-in mechanism. Interoperability with other devices in the market is
 achieved by conformance to very strict requirements of DLNA and on the fly
 conversion of media to format that client devices are capable of handling.
 .
 This package contains the core of Rygel and following plugins:
   * media-export: Recursively exports folders and files specified in the
     user configuration. This plugin supports all types of URIs that
     gio/gvfs and GStreamer can handle.
   * external: A MediaServer plugin that exports media hierarchies
     provided by external applications.
   * mpris: Export of media players that implement MPRIS2 D-Bus interface,
     as MediaRenderer devices.

Description: SANE backend for AirScan (eSCL) and WSD document scanner
 Similar to how most modern network printers support "driverless"
 printing, using the universal vendor-neutral printing protocol, many
 modern network scanners and MFPs support "driverless" scanning.
 .
 Driverless scanning comes in two flavors:
 .
 * Apple AirScan or AirPrint scanning (official protocol name is eSCL)
 * Microsoft WSD, or WS-Scan (term WSD means "Web Services for Devices)
 .
 This backend implements both protocols, choosing automatically between
 them. It was successfully tested with many devices from Brother, Canon,
 Kyocera, Lexmark, Epson, HP, Ricoh, Samsung and Xerox both in WSD and
 eSCL modes.

 SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
 programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
 raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
 video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
 free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
 current source code is written to support several operating systems,
 including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
 under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
 backends are welcome, too, however).
 .
 This package includes the command line frontend scanimage, the saned
 server and the sane-find-scanner utility, along with their documentation.

    via uinput. This will only work if the active X-session is running a
    spice-vdagent process so that its resolution can be determined.
  - Automatic adjustment of the X-session resolution to the client resolution
  - Support of copy and paste (text and images) between the active X-session
    and the client

Description: Tool to create and append to squashfs filesystems
 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux. It uses zlib
 compression to compress both files, inodes and directories. Inodes in the
 system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead.
 Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival use
 (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained block
 device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is needed.

Description: System call tracer
 strace is a system call tracer: i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
 a trace of all the system calls made by another process/program.
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have source.
 .
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

Description: Advanced version control system
 Apache Subversion, also known as svn, is a centralised version control
 system.  Version control systems allow many individuals (who may be
 distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of files (source
 code, websites, etc).  Subversion began with a CVS paradigm and
 supports all the major features of CVS, but has evolved to support
 many features that CVS users often wish they had.
 .
 This package includes the Subversion client (svn, svnsync), repository
 administration tools (svnadmin, svnlook) and a network server (svnserve).

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/lib/systemd/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Version: 1.41-4build3
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.38)
Description: Collection of simple Type 1 font manipulation programs
 The t1utils tools allow you to convert between PFA (ASCII) and PFB
 (binary) formats; disassemble PFA or PFB files into human-readable
 form; and reassemble the human-readable files into PFA or PFB format
 files.  You can also  extract font resources from a Macintosh font
 file (ATM/Laserwriter), or create a Macintosh Type 1 font file from a
 PFA or PFB font.
 .
 There are currently six programs:
 .
  t1ascii   Converts PFB files to PFA format.
 .
  t1binary  Converts PFA files to PFB format.
 .
  t1disasm  Disassembles a Type 1 font (PFA or PFB format) into a raw,
            human-readable text form for subsequent hand editing,
            tweaking, hint fixing, etcetera...
 .
  t1asm     Assembles a Type 1 font into PFA or PFB format from
            the human-readable form produced by t1disasm.
 .
  t1unmac   Extracts POST resources from a Macintosh Type 1 font file
            (ATM/Laserwriter) into PFA or PFB format for use outside
            the Macintosh environment.  The Macintosh file should be
            stored in MacBinary, AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex
            format, or as a raw resource fork.  Note that t1unmac does
            not have to run on a Macintosh, but makes Macintosh Type 1
            fonts available for use on Unix machines and PCs.
 .
  t1mac     Creates a Macintosh Type 1 file from a PFA- or PFB-format
            Type 1 font. Writes the Macintosh file in MacBinary,
            AppleSingle, AppleDouble, or BinHex format, or as a raw
            resource fork.  WARNING: This tool will not suffice to
            allow you to use the new font on a Macintosh, as
            Macintoshes cannot read raw Type 1 fonts.  You will need
            to create a font suitcase containing bitmap fonts.  If you
            do not already have such a suitcase for the font, T1utils
            will not help you create one.

 texlive-fonts-extra due to availability in separate  packages. . For
 documents searching these fonts by file name instead of using fontconfig
 lookups, the font files need to be linked into the TEXMF tree of TeX Live.
 This package ships these links and depends on all the font packages
 required.

 The 'time' command runs another program, then displays information
 about the resources used by that program, collected by the system while
 the program was running.  You can select which information is reported
 and the format in which it is shown, or have 'time' save the information
 in a file instead of display it on the screen.
 .
 The resources that 'time' can report on fall into the general
 categories of time, memory, I/O, and IPC calls.
 .
 The GNU version can format the output in arbitrary ways by using a
 printf-style format string to include various resource measurements.

Description: system for processing phonetic symbols in LaTeX
 TIPA is a system for processing IPA (International Phonetic
 Alphabet) symbols in LaTeX written by Fukui Rei.  TIPA stands for
 either TeX IPA or Tokyo IPA and derived from the tsipa package, made
 in 1992 by Kobayashi Hajime, Fukui Rei and Shirakawa Shun.
 .
 Among many features of TIPA, the following are the new features as
 compared with tsipa or any other existing systems for processing IPA
 symbols:
 .
   * A new 256 character encoding for phonetic symbols (`T3'), which
     includes all the symbols and diacritics found in the recent
     versions of IPA and some non-IPA symbols.
   * Complete support of LaTeX2e.
   * Roman, slanted, bold, bold extended and sans serif font styles.
   * Easy input method in the IPA environment.
   * Extended macros for accents and diacritics.
   * A flexible system of macros for `tone letters'.
   * An optional package (vowel.sty) for drawing vowel diagrams.
   * A slightly modified set of fonts that go well when used with
     Times Roman and Helvetica fonts.
 .
 Type 1 fonts for TIPA are also included in this package (to make them
 available in X11 applications other than LaTeX, please install the
 xfonts-tipa package).

Description: terminal multiplexer
 tmux enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be accessed and
 controlled from a single terminal like screen. tmux runs as a
 server-client system. A server is created automatically when necessary
 and holds a number of sessions, each of which may have a number of
 windows linked to it. Any number of clients may connect to a session,
 or the server may be controlled by issuing commands with tmux.
 Communication takes place through a socket, by default placed in /tmp.
 Moreover tmux provides a consistent and well-documented command
 interface, with the same syntax whether used interactively, as a key
 binding, or from the shell. It offers a choice of vim or Emacs key
 layouts.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".
 .

Description: runtime components for the Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit Universally Unique
 IDs (UUIDs). A UUID is an identifier that is unique within the space
 of all such identifiers across both space and time. It can be used for
 multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely short lifetime
 to reliably identifying very persistent objects across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon.
 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate UUIDs, especially time-based
 UUIDs, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face of
 large numbers of threads trying to grab UUIDs running on different CPUs.
 It is used by libuuid as well as the uuidgen program.

 Valgrind is a system for debugging and profiling Linux programs. With its tool
 suite you can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs,
 avoiding hours of frustrating bug-hunting and making your programs more stable.
 You can also perform detailed profiling to help speed up your programs and use
 Valgrind to build new tools.
 .
 The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality tools:
  * a memory error detector (Memcheck)
  * two thread error detectors (Helgrind and DRD)
  * a cache and branch-prediction profiler (Cachegrind)
  * a call-graph generating cache and branch-prediction profiler (Callgrind)
  * a heap profiler (Massif)
 It also includes three experimental tools:
  * a stack/global array overrun detector (SGCheck)
  * a second heap profiler that examines how heap blocks are used (DHAT)
  * a SimPoint basic block vector generator (BBV)

Description: Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix (driver metapackage)
 VDPAU (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix) is an open source
 library (libvdpau) and API designed by NVIDIA originally for its GeForce
 8 series and later GPU hardware, targeted at the X Window System on Unix
 operating-systems (including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris). This VDPAU API
 allows video programs to offload portions of the video decoding process
 and video post-processing to the GPU video-hardware.
 .
 This package depends on the full suite of drivers for the VDPAU API.
 It does not provide any drivers itself, and may be removed if you wish to
 only have certain drivers installed.

Description: Sends 'magic packets' to wake-on-LAN enabled ethernet adapters

 You need the MAC addresses of machines to construct the WOL packets, but,
 in contrast to 'etherwake', you do not need root privileges to use the
 program itself as UDP packets are used.

Description: Compares two files word by word
 `wdiff' is a front-end to GNU `diff'.  It compares two files, finding
 which words have been deleted or added to the first in order to create
 the second.  It has many output formats and interacts well with
 terminals and pagers (notably with `less').  `wdiff' is particularly
 useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs have
 been refilled.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: X Window System (X.Org) infrastructure
 x11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration; it does not
 provide a full installation of clients, servers, libraries, and utilities
 required to run the X Window System.
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X",
 "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in
 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and

 originally part of the Flatpak project, but it has been broken out as
 a standalone module to facilitate using it in other contexts, for
 example in WebKit-GTK's optional bubblewrap-based sandbox.
 .
 For this proxy to be useful, restricted D-Bus clients must be denied
 access to the normal D-Bus socket (for example by using containers or
 AppArmor rules), and instead given access to the listening Unix socket
 created by the proxy (typically by bind-mounting it into a Linux
 container).

Description: desktop integration portal for Flatpak and Snap
 xdg-desktop-portal provides a portal frontend service for Flatpak, Snap,
 and possibly other desktop containment/sandboxing frameworks. This service
 is made available to the sandboxed application, and provides mediated
 D-Bus interfaces for file access, URI opening, printing and similar
 desktop integration features.
 .
 The implementation of these interfaces is expected to require
 user confirmation before responding to the sandboxed application's
 requests. For example, when the sandboxed application ask to open a file,
 the portal implementation will open an "Open" dialog outside the sandbox,
 and will only make the selected file available to the sandboxed app if
 that dialog is confirmed.
 .
 xdg-desktop-portal is designed to be desktop-agnostic, and uses a
 desktop-environment-specific GUI backend such as xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
 to provide its functionality.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

 XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated
 on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can
 support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,
 variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
 Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
 and scalability.

Description: command line ISO-9660 and Rock Ridge manipulation tool
 xorriso is a command line and dialog application, which creates, loads,
 manipulates, and writes ISO-9660 file system images with Rock Ridge
 extensions.
 .
 It maps file objects from POSIX compliant file systems into Rock Ridge
 enhanced ISO-9660 file systems and features session-wise manipulation
 of such file systems. It can load the management information of existing
 ISO images and write the resulting session to optical medium or as
 file system objects.
 .
 Supported optical media types:
  - CD-R, CD-RW
  - DVD-R, DVD-R DL, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+R DL, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM
  - BD-R, BD-RE
 .
 Some interesting features:
  - Emulation of the mkisofs and cdrecord programs.
  - Data backup and restore capabilities - compression, ACLs, and filters.
  - Isohybrid MBR with partition offset - features booting ISOLINUX from
    USB sticks, or from other devices that appear to PC-BIOS as hard disks.
    The images carry a conventional partition table for a USB stick;
    the first partition reports the size of the ISO image, but starts at a
    non-zero address. It is nevertheless still mountable.
  - Jigdo Template Export - jigdo representation of the resulting ISO-9660
    image, generated on the fly.
 .
 Test suite:
  xorriso source code comes with a release engineering test-suite called
  `releng', which aims to cover most of the functionality of the xorriso
  and the underlying libraries of libburn, libisofs, and libisoburn.

Description: X terminal emulator
 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102
 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the
 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of
 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.
 .
 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional
 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is
 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8
 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the luit
 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the
 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the
 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.
 .
 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator
 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.
 .
 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.
 .
 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the
 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Architecture: amd64
Version: 1.1.1-1build5
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.34), libext2fs2t64 (>= 1.42)
Description: zero free blocks from ext2, ext3 and ext4 file-systems
 Zerofree finds the unallocated blocks with non-zero value content in
 an ext2, ext3 or ext4 file-system and fills them with zeroes
 (zerofree can also work with another value than zero). This is mostly
 useful if the device on which this file-system resides is a disk
 image. In this case, depending on the type of disk image, a secondary
 utility may be able to reduce the size of the disk image after
 zerofree has been run. Zerofree requires the file-system to be
 unmounted or mounted read-only.
 .
 The usual way to achieve the same result (zeroing the unused
 blocks) is to run "dd" to create a file full of zeroes that takes up
 the entire free space on the drive, and then delete this file. This
 has many disadvantages, which zerofree alleviates:
  * it is slow;
  * it makes the disk image (temporarily) grow to its maximal extent;
  * it (temporarily) uses all free space on the disk, so other
    concurrent write actions may fail.
 .
 Zerofree has been written to be run from GNU/Linux systems installed
 as guest OSes inside a virtual machine. If this is not your case, you
 almost certainly don't need this package. (One other use case would
 be to erase sensitive data a little bit more securely than with a
 simple "rm").
